Hey. I'm Ashley—the one and only human behind this repo (and all the others here or with the CheckMarK name on them). If you’ve stumbled across something security-related—a leak, a loophole, a weird edge case with evil vibes—thank you. I want to hear about it.

## 🚨 What Counts as a Security Issue?

Here’s what I *definitely* want to know about:

- Secrets or API keys doing the walk of shame outside `.env`
- Auth bypasses, permission bugs, impersonation quirks, or “wait how did you even get here” moments
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies or automation
- Anything that lets someone do ✨spicy✨ things they shouldn’t

Things that *don’t* count (but I admire your curiosity):

- DOS attacks that require you to summon CPU demons with 100k requests per second
- Bugs that are annoying but not security-related
- Stuff that breaks only in IE6, Node 10, or cursed edge cases from 2012

## 📬 How to Report It

**Please don’t open a public issue** that starts with “this whole repo is a security disaster” or "repo insecure AF."

Instead, email me directly at:

**✉️ [human@checkmarkdevtools.dev](mailto:human@checkmarkdevtools.dev)**

Include:
- What you found
- How to reproduce it
- Bonus points for screenshots, logs, or cursed diagrams in Notion or Paint

I’ll read it. I’ll fix it. I might even send back a thank-you gif (no promises, depends how dramatic it is).

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure Policy

- I take security seriously, even if this file doesn’t sound like it.
- Let me know privately so I can fix things before they hit the internet and I'm drinking weird caffeinated mixtures after dark.
- If it’s legit, I’ll shout you out—or not, if you prefer to remain the cool mysterious hacker in the shadows.
- Please don’t publish it before I’ve had time to clean up the mess. I’ll be fast. Probably...

Thanks for keeping the chaos constructive. 🫶
