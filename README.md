> **DevTO-Mirror** helps make your dev.to blogs more discoverable by search engines by automatically generating and hosting a mirror site with generous `robots.txt` rules. Avoiding Dante‚Äôs DevOps and the maintenance headache. This is a simple html, no frills approach with a sitemap and robots.tx ‚Äî _that's it_. If you're like me and treat some comments as mini-posts, you can selectively pull in the ones that deserve their own page.

## How it works üöÄ

* Runs ~~hourly~~ daily at **`9:15 AM EST`** so you (almost) never post exactly on the mirror time
* Uses a **single repo variable**: `DEVTO_USERNAME` ‚Äî your Dev.to username
* Derives everything else (GitHub Pages URL, repository context) automatically
* Generates: `index.html`, `/posts/*.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`
* **Comments:** provides a way to index those special comments that are worthy of mini-post status by pulling your predefined comments into dedicated /comments/ pages with your blurb and context
* `robots.txt` welcomes major AI crawlers (toggle as you like): GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Claude-Web, Google-Extended, PerplexityBot, Bytespider, CCBot (Common Crawl), and more üëç

### First Run

- Fetches all posts from the RSS feed
- Generates HTML files for all posts
- Creates `posts_data.json` to track all posts
- Generates `index.html` and `sitemap.xml`

### Subsequent Runs

- Fetches latest posts from RSS feed
- Compares against existing posts in `posts_data.json`
- Only processes NEW posts (stops when it finds an existing post)
- Generates HTML files only for new posts
- Updates `posts_data.json` with new posts at the top
- Regenerates `index.html` and `sitemap.xml` with complete post list

**Note on Descriptions:** Post descriptions are automatically truncated to 160 characters to align with SEO best practices for search engine result snippets.

# Dev.to Mirror

![social card](https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror/blob/main/assets/devto-mirror.jpg)

This repository contains a tiny static mirror generator for Dev.to posts. It fetches posts from the Dev.to RSS feed and produces a minimal, crawler-friendly static site with canonical links back to Dev.to.

## What this repository contains

- `scripts/generate_site.py` ‚Äî generator script that reads Dev.to RSS, produces `posts/` HTML files, `index.html`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`, and persists post metadata to `posts_data.json`.
- `posts/` ‚Äî generated HTML files for individual posts.
- `posts_data.json` ‚Äî generated metadata tracking the known posts.
- `comments/` ‚Äî optional generated note pages for comment links.
- `assets/` ‚Äî images and static assets.

## Usage

Set the required environment variables and run the generator locally:

```bash
export DEVTO_USERNAME="your-username"
# Optionally set PAGES_REPO (e.g. username/repo). If not set, the script derives it from the git remote.
python scripts/generate_site.py
```

The first run generates all posts found in the RSS feed and writes `posts_data.json`. Subsequent runs update the archive incrementally and regenerate `index.html` and `sitemap.xml`.



## Notes

- The generator uses `feedparser`, `jinja2`, and `python-slugify`.
- Environment variables required: `DEVTO_USERNAME` (the Dev.to username). `PAGES_REPO` is optional but can be set to `username/repo`.

## Local test

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install feedparser jinja2 python-slugify
DEVTO_USERNAME=yourname PAGES_REPO=username/repo python scripts/generate_site.py
open index.html
```
