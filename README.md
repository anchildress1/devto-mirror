# Dev.to Mirror — The Set-and-Forget AI Crawler

This Copilot generated utility helps make your Dev.to blogs more discoverable by search engines by automatically generating and hosting a mirror site with generous `robots.txt` rules. Avoiding Dante’s DevOps and the maintenance headache. This is a simple html, no frills approach with a sitemap and robots.tx — _that's it_ (although I'm slowly working through enhancements). If you're like me and treat some comments as mini-posts, you can selectively pull in the ones that deserve their own page.

> The internet already changed — blink and you missed it. We don't Google anymore; we ask ChatGPT (the wise ones even ask for sources). 🤖
>
> - **When I searched**: my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/anchildress1) showed up just as expected
> - **When I asked Gemini the same thing**: crickets. 🦗
>
> So yeah, obvious disconnect... Also, I'm _not_ hosting a blog on my domain (I'm a backend dev; hosting a pretty blog + analytics sounds like a relaxing afternoon with Dante's DevOps. Hard pass. 🔥🫠), but I still want control of `robots.txt.`
>
> **Enter the five-minute ChatGPT fix:** a tiny static mirror with canonicals back to **Dev.to** — no domain, no analytics — just (practically) instantly crawlable 😉🐜.
>
> P.S. "Five minutes" usually means two hours. Acceptable losses. 😅 And seriously, writing this blurb took longer than the code. 🤨 Alright.... **3 hours** (it took me an hour to get the picture just right, enough anyway). Still worth it! 😅

## What is this?

Auto-generates a static mirror of your Dev.to blog with generous `robots.txt` for AI crawlers. Simple HTML, sitemap, canonical links — zero maintenance.

---

## Quick Setup ⚡

1. Fork this repo
2. Set repository variable: Settings → Actions → Variables → Add `DEVTO_USERNAME`
3. Delete `gh-pages` branch if it exists
4. Run workflow: [Actions → "Generate and Publish Dev.to Mirror Site" → Run workflow](https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror/actions)
5. Enable Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `gh-pages`

> Auto-updates weekly (Wednesdays) at 9:40 AM EDT.

---

## How it works

- Fetches posts via Dev.to API (incremental updates via `last_run.txt` timestamp)
- Generates HTML files with canonical links back to Dev.to
- Creates sitemap, robots.txt, index
- Optional: Include special comments as standalone pages via `comments.txt`

**Refresh everything:** Actions → "Generate and Publish Dev.to Mirror Site" and set `force_full_regen` to `true` (creates backup, wipes, regenerates)

## Local Development



```bash
git clone https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror.git

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DEVTO_USERNAME and PAGES_REPO

# Run full validation
make validate

# Generate site locally
python scripts/generate_site.py
```

## License 📄

Every project has to have a stack of fine print somewhere. _Keep going, keep going, keep going..._ Here's mine, as painless as possible:

You know where [the license](./LICENSE) is, but I'll sum it up: **this is not open source** (even though you can still do just about anything you want with it). As long as you're not turning it into the next big SaaS or selling subscriptions in the cloud, then have fun! Else, **you've gotta ask me first.**

Basically? This project's got boundaries. Be cool, don't try to sneak it into a product launch, and we'll get along just fine. 😘
