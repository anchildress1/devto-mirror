So, for this post üëá, we're doing the \"just enough to be dangerous\" thing. I'll hit you with the absolute must-knows, show you how to get started (in 10 minutes or less), and <em>hopefully</em>, not put you to sleep in the process (or myself!). </p>\n\n<p>My goal is to give you a \"preview teaser\" so you can go play, explore a bit, and maybe even tackle that hack time project you keep putting off. But whatever you do, <em>please</em> don't think this is your all-inclusive pass to go wild on production code. ü´°</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\" href=\"#coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\">\n  </a>\n  Coding Agent ‚â† Agent Mode ü§™\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, let's get something straight right off the bat, because these names are just asking for trouble. Yes, they both have \"GitHub\" and \"Agent\" in the name. And yes, they're both powered by Claude Sonnet 4, but <strong>that's where the similarities stop.</strong> Agent Mode is for in-IDE use, a bit like a sidekick who waits for you to tell it what to do next. Coding Agent? It's the whole show ‚Äî a full-on autonomous workflow that runs on its own dedicated VM. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> Custom instructions and prompt techniques are the secret sauce here. This is true for any Gen-AI tool, but it's <em>especially critical</em> with Coding Agent, which will just keep guessing until it runs out of steam or thinks the job is done. Don't let it run wild without a map!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don't worry, Coding Agent is designed with safety in mind. It's an incredibly contained, safe version of the \"autonomous coding\" experiment I ran on my own a while back. I spent 45 days arguing with a thing I wired up on my laptop, and I worked harder then than on any other project I've built before or since. </p>\n\n<p>Why? Because I didn't want to just listen to what people were saying about AI ‚Äî I <em>needed</em> to see it for myself. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ And that, my friends, is why I'm here volunteering as your guide. If you get stuck, hit me up! I've probably tried it that way plus three other insane ideas before I found one that mostly worked üôÉ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"safety-first-chaos-second\" href=\"#safety-first-chaos-second\">\n  </a>\n  Safety First, Chaos Second üõ°Ô∏è\n</h2>\n\n<p>I know, I know... I just spent a whole paragraph telling you how much I love this thing, and now I'm gonna give you the other half of the equation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm all for pushing a new tool to its absolute limit, just to see what happens. It reminds me of my favorite Hunter S. Thompson quote ‚Äî which I slightly mangled to get a SFW version ‚Äî but the core truth remains: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you find a new, beautiful wave, <strong>the tendency is to push it as far as you can.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, how far can you push GitHub Coding Agent? Pretty far, but there are a few things you need to know first.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\" href=\"#1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\">\n  </a>\n  1. Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You <em>Should</em>\n</h3>\n\n<p>This tool can absolutely excel, but it requires the right prompt, instructions, and general setup. If you're looking to dive into some legacy code to see what's what, or maybe you want a safe playground to mess around in, then this is your guy! </p>\n\n<p>But if you're thinking about using it to fix a production bug, especially when you're on a tight deadline, you probably (aka absolutely, most definitely) want to reconsider. Treat this as a \"learn how this works\" project, not a \"throw it at a problem and hope\" situation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-your-prompt-is-everything\" href=\"#2-your-prompt-is-everything\">\n  </a>\n  2. Your Prompt is Everything\n</h3>\n\n<p>The effectiveness of your instructions and prompt is multiplied exponentially by the complexity of your task. A great, well-thought-out set of instructions that you've carefully tweaked over weeks? Coding Agent will do fine. But if you spend 10 minutes throwing a few sentences together just to see what happens, don't be surprised when you come back to a haunted house where your beautiful little cottage of a codebase used to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ It is an agent and when an agent doesn't know something, <em>they guess</em>. <strong>That's just what they do.</strong> The only thing more dangerous than an AI off the rails and hallucinating is the fact that you just turned it loose on your code all by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-its-actually-good-for\" href=\"#what-its-actually-good-for\">\n  </a>\n  What It's Actually Good For ‚ú®\n</h2>\n\n<p>After all those warnings, I need to make it crystal clear: <strong>this tool is not dangerous.</strong> It runs on its own virtual machine and executes safely within GitHub Actions. It has a limited environment and only has access to what you explicitly give it. </p>\n\n<p>It <strong>always creates a new branch</strong>, which is a key safety feature. You can't get around it, even if you try. Trust me, I was annoyed, but the safety is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you realistically use this for? Here are some of my favorite real-world use cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation:</strong> Nothing has worked better for me than using Coding Agent to dive deep into a codebase and spit out test-ready use cases or a handful of detailed system architecture Mermaid diagrams. You set it loose, go get a coffee, and come back to 7-8 pages of detailed, well-researched use cases ready to be plugged in.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing:</strong> This one's a little controversial for a test-driven development purist like me, <em>but</em>... when you're on a deadline and you just need to get things done, you can write the code and have Coding Agent go write the tests. It's not a perfect solution, but a pull request with 28/30 passing tests is way better than one with zero tests at all. ü§´ü´£</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project Planning:</strong> Got a big initiative coming up? Instead of spending a week flipping through pages of dead code to figure out how it used to work, you can have Coding Agent do the heavy lifting and print out a nifty little report when it's done. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\" href=\"#how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\">\n  </a>\n  How to Get Started in 5 Minutes or Less ‚è±Ô∏è\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the interest of time and keeping this digestible, I'm going to give you the basics that will work 100% of the time. We'll dig in on some more tools next week.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub has made this incredibly accessible now. You can find the new <strong>agents panel</strong> button on just about every page in GitHub: both on the home page and within any repository.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2\" alt=\"GitHub new agents panel view to access Coding Agent\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"669\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Select the Repository and Base Branch:</strong> Choose the repo and the branch you want Coding Agent to work from. It will <em>always</em> create its own branch, so don't worry about selecting <code>main</code> (or a trunk-based development model) if that's your primary branch. I'm telling you, you can <em>try</em> to tell it not to create a branch, but it's not going to listen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Craft Your Prompt:</strong> This is <em>not</em> your typical conversational prompting. Coding Agent <em>will keep guessing</em> until it reaches what it considers to be \"complete.\" Save yourself the headache and give it all the info up front.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Submit Your Request:</strong> Every time you hit send, it's considered one premium request. This is why it's so important to be concise and provide all the context it needs upfront.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> To save premium requests when reviewing Copilot's PR, go to the diff page and leave all your <code>@copilot</code> comments as pending. When you're ready, submit them all at once, and it will only cost you <em>one request</em> whether you leave two comments or 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"a-final-warning-about-responsibility\" href=\"#a-final-warning-about-responsibility\">\n  </a>\n  A Final Warning About Responsibility üòà\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, one last thing. I have to let this sink in: </p>\n\n<p><strong>If it's <em>your</em> prompt, it's <em>your code</em>. Period.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you go out and give a prompt to Copilot, ignore it for 30 minutes, do a half-hearted review, approve your own pull request, override the protection rules to push it to main, and then the codebase burns down... that's <strong>not</strong> Copilot's fault. That's your fault. Your prompt, your branch, your code, AI or not.</p>\n\n<p>So, be aware, be smart, and <em>please</em> don't use this as an excuse to ignore the basics. Start small with documentation or tests, and work your way up.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"lets-get-real\" href=\"#lets-get-real\">\n  </a>\n  Let's Get Real ü§®\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you tried GitHub Coding Agent yet?

Five bucks a month isn‚Äôt exactly breaking the bank, so I thought, fine, maybe I‚Äôll toss a few posts over there alongside LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>That <em>was</em> the plan.

Metadata doesn‚Äôt count.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you lean on AI for anything beyond grammar, you can write on Medium, but you‚Äôll never get boosted, partnered, or featured.

I write because it‚Äôs fun, because I need a break from code, and because I have opinions the world clearly needs to hear. üòâ </p>\n\n<p><strong>AI doesn‚Äôt erase my voice ‚Äî it sharpens it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So calling everything in between spellcheck and prompt-posting off limits? No appeal, no nuance, just blanket exclusion? <em>That‚Äôs</em> where I‚Äôm lost.</p>\n\n<p>Developers talk nonstop about AI. Colleges too. It‚Äôs a huge, messy, <strong>important conversation</strong>. And Medium ‚Äî the site that prides itself on being the ‚Äútop blogging platform‚Äù ‚Äî takes the most stereotypical, exclusionary stance possible. ChatGPT usually gets painted as the villain here, but really, it‚Äôs just the stand-in for all the tools that make the work easier.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, it feels less like quality control and more like gatekeeping.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Confession time: when I first started writing this post, I was <strong>mad</strong>. Not mildly irritated, not ‚Äúeh, I‚Äôll just wait for the next patch‚Äù annoyed. I mean genuinely fed up with Copilot, ChatGPT, and everything GPT-5 in general. And if I make it to the end of this post in one piece, maybe you'll understand why.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-funeral\" href=\"#the-funeral\">\n  </a>\n  The Funeral üëª\n</h2>\n\n<p>First, let me start this out by stating that OpenAI has officially buried the excuse that GPT can‚Äôt code. We had the funeral over the weekend. All its friends were invited. Laid to rest. Cremation done. Trees planted. Memorial service complete. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It‚Äôs done ‚Äî GPT-5 can code.</strong> Full stop.</p>\n\n<p>There's no room for debate. No more hacks with pages of instructions or GPT hanging out on the sidelines because it's busy staring at the plan. OpenAI <em>nailed it</em> with an absolutely solid model.</p>\n\n<p>Plus VS Code's release came with some more experimental features that turns the already-solid GPT-5 in to a ‚Äúsend a prompt, make a plan, deep thinking, Implementation Specialist at your service‚Äù experience. That being said, I still haven't had nearly enough time with the full model yet.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Why, you ask? Because my brilliant self left my personal account logged in while working last week. That account? It's the cheap $10 one. I burned through <em>all</em> my premium requests before I even noticed. ü´•</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So yes, GPT-5 (the real one) passed its early test runs beautifully ‚Äî small to medium features, planning and implementation, no complaints. But the deep dive it deserves? That‚Äôs still coming ‚Äî stay tuned.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What was I doing instead of the GPT-5 deep dive? Playing the lead role in the horror story of Full House starring Kimmy Gibbler and the never-ending wall of text. üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòë</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"duct-tape-please\" href=\"#duct-tape-please\">\n  </a>\n  Duct Tape, Please? ü§ê\n</h2>\n\n<p>GPT-5-Mini is not bad. Let‚Äôs clear that up. For small, targeted context? For quick features? For implementing a clearly defined task with accuracy and precision? <strong>It‚Äôs great.</strong> Honestly. Kimmy Gibbler is a surprisingly solid coder.</p>\n\n<p>But the output.<br>\nOh. My. God. The. Output. ü´®üò≤üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>\n\n<p>I'm talking about <em>walls and walls</em> of text. Waterfalls of ‚Äúlook at me, I wrote a test!‚Äù status updates flooding my chat window like it's trying to set a world record. No, Kimmy, I don‚Äôt need a play-by-play novella about the journey you took to create a three-line function. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Sure ‚Äî I started out at least <em>trying</em> to skim what it was saying. But my sanity didn't last long into that battle. Seriously, if I read another scroll of verbose rambling I might have retreated to some dark corner until next Tuesday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-standoff\" href=\"#the-standoff\">\n  </a>\n  The Standoff\n</h3>\n\n<p>At one point, it got <strong>so bad</strong> that I set up a stand-off. I told GPT something along the lines of, ‚ÄúGo check on that workflow. If it works, give me a checkmark. <em>That‚Äôs it.</em> If you say anything else, I‚Äôm turning you off forever.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>It complied.

Maybe. For about thirty seconds. Then the rambling resumed. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs what I didn‚Äôt realize at first: I had also turned on every single experimental preview feature in VS Code. That‚Äôs my usual routine ‚Äî release notes drop, I‚Äôm flipping switches left and right.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>thought</em> I was enabling a neat little planning checklist feature. Which to be fair, I <em>did</em> do that... I also omitted its counterpart to internalize that chatter. Which meant the Mini chaos doubled ‚Äî and nothing I added to the prompts or instructions made a bit of difference. üò´</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ I even tried to tame it with a new <strong>Principal Pragmatist</strong> chat mode. Didn‚Äôt matter. Kimmy kept talking. Nonstop floods of text testing my sanity at every turn. Thanks, Kimmy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"leatherface-joins-the-party\" href=\"#leatherface-joins-the-party\">\n  </a>\n  Leatherface Joins the Party\n</h2>\n\n<p>GitHub Copilot is only part of the equation, though. Because just when I thought I‚Äôd found a rhythm there, here comes ChatGPT starring as Leatherface, chainsaw roaring, doing a happy dance all over my carefully constructed blog draft. Shredding paragraphs. Scattering virtual scraps across the room. Obliterating what had been a perfectly flowing system of prompts and edits.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ I mean, this post normally would have taken me a couple of hours. Instead, three days later, I'm <em>still</em> wrestling Leatherface for control of my own sentences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commands escalated. From firm. To censored. To questioning life choices. And finally, full-on ultimatum. I even took a few hours detour with Gemini ‚Äî proof that I'm willing to go to war with an LLM over word count. (I'm also <em>still</em> losing that battle!)</p>\n\n<p>The moral of the story? While GPT-5 is a great coder ‚Äî it is <strong>more than terrible</strong> at creative writing. So, why do we have a single model replacement for 2 completely different problems, OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"where-we-are-now\" href=\"#where-we-are-now\">\n  </a>\n  Where We Are Now\n</h2>\n\n<p>So where does that leave things?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GPT-5: rock-solid coder, worthy of the ‚ÄúImplementation Specialist‚Äù title, but still waiting for its fair turn in the spotlight with me.</li>\n<li>Mini: great in short bursts, but <strong>do not</strong> let her narrate. Especially not with <em>every</em> experimental feature flipped on. Else plan for duct tape.</li>\n<li>ChatGPT: still a chainsaw in a library butchering my every attempt at creative writing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And me? Still here. Still writing. Still dragging you through the chaos with me, because apparently this is how I process the fact that we had a funeral for ‚ÄúGPT can‚Äôt code‚Äù and I celebrated it by duct-taping Gibbler and dodging Leatherface.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like a victory, right?

Try my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10-minute DevTo crawly mirror</a>. Here's how it works:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Clone the repo</strong>. Enter your DevTO username as an env variable in the repo.

I honestly can‚Äôt remember now ‚Äî Copilot, debugging, something in that ballpark. Doesn‚Äôt matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But somehow ‚Äî like so many of my rabbit holes ‚Äî it mutated and morphed until I wasn't exactly at the same place I had started. I really can't explain the series of events that happened after that. I blame it on <em>curiosity</em> more than anything, but I did the one thing I swore I'd never do: I asked ChatGPT to do a quick search ‚Äî pull one of my posts.</p>\n\n<p>And... <strong>nothing</strong>. Like the post didn‚Äôt exist. üï≥Ô∏è</p>\n\n<p>Okay. üòÖ Fine. Let‚Äôs take a step back. Next, I went straight to Google and typed the same thing. Results were <em>better</em> ‚Äî sure. Scroll, scroll, scroll... and <strong>there</strong> it was. My post. Not at the top, but alive. Win. üòè</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ <strong>Real talk</strong>: Do I care about being #1? No, not in the slightest. Honestly, I love my invisibility bubble ‚Äî keeps things peaceful in my corner of the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But here‚Äôs the thing: invisibility and AI don‚Äôt mix. Because when I need an answer, I don‚Äôt open a browser anymore. I yell at my phone: ‚ÄúHey Google!‚Äù Or I pop into ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>\n\n<p>If my posts don‚Äôt show up there, they might as well not even exist. ü´§</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\" href=\"#d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\">\n  </a>\n  D√©j√† Vu üîÆ\n</h2>\n\n<p>So I‚Äôm now blessed with the knowledge that my posts are basically hiding out in the Room of Requirement ‚Äî you know it‚Äôs there, but only if the stars align. And <strong>that</strong> makes it hard to share the advice I keep repeating everywhere else that will listen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>‚ÄúYes, you can use it for debugging.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúOf course it can generate the tests.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúDocs? Oh my god, PLEASE let it write the docs.‚Äù</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the time I‚Äôve said it for the fifth time, it feels like I‚Äôm stuck in reruns.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Honestly, some days I feel like I need a theme song: ‚ÄúPreviously, on AI Adventures with Ashley...‚Äù üéµüé∂</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure. <em>Sometimes</em>, I let AI run wild (it's more fun that way!). My Coding Agent kills it with documentation. I even built a chat mode that plays architect ‚Äî reverse engineers a repo and spits out mermaid diagrams like it‚Äôs dealing cards in Vegas. That one runs in GitHub Actions, then opens a PR, and I'll merge once everything checks out.</p>\n\n<p>But the everyday stuff? It‚Äôs not dramatic. It‚Äôs small instructions, nudges, prompts. Rinse, repeat, <em>coffee</em>, repeat again. ‚òïÔ∏è It's slow, incremental improvements to be just a little better than yesterday. ü§è</p>\n\n<p>And what drives me absolutely up the wall? The extremes. Either ‚ÄúAI will replace every dev tomorrow‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI is useless, don‚Äôt bother.‚Äù</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ <strong>Honestly</strong>, it‚Äôs like sitting court-side at Quidditch ‚Äî the little guy zips across the field so fast you think you‚Äôve finally caught up, but nope.

That‚Äôs what most of these blog posts are. Whatever comes up that week ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs me digging, someone else asking, or just another repeated question ‚Äî if I haven‚Äôt covered it already, give me a week. I'll get there.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this system? Instead of explaining everything for the tenth time, I can just say: ‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôre trying this. I think my blog might help ‚Äî here‚Äôs the link. Let me know if you‚Äôve got questions.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>See. Simple, right? üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è But even <em>that</em> wasn‚Äôt enough, because usually by the time I arrived on scene things were in somewhat of a state already. Mostly because what AI <em>was</em> helping with had a knowledge cut-off of January and everything else is wading through Microsoft or GitHub docs looking for any little nibble.</p>\n\n<p>So I set out to find a way to make my DevTo posts truly crawly ‚Äî <em>without</em>  Dante's DevOps nightmares playing on repeat at the top of every hour. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Sure, I <em>briefly</em> considered the real solution ‚Äî custom website, full hosting stack, the whole front-end shebang.

They work everywhere Copilot runs ‚Äî IDE, GitHub.com, even mobile (according to the docs anyway). Put them in <code>main</code>, and suddenly everyone prompting Copilot is working from the same rules, style, and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch‚Äù list.</p>\n\n<p>If you're thinking about simply listing best coding practices just to show Copilot where commas go? You're not using them correctly. Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use <code>applyTo</code> in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in <code>.github/instructions/database.instructions.md</code> instead of the default file and add the <code>applyTo</code>. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">src/main/java/dao/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># My Custom Database Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\" href=\"#the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\">\n  </a>\n  The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\" href=\"#1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\">\n  </a>\n  1.

My job is 100% remote with distributed teammates from the Pacific US to India. We‚Äôre a relatively small team ‚Äî fewer than 10 devs ‚Äî split into three different dev roles. But I‚Äôm regularly chatting with other teams and posting in random channels (mostly the AI ones ‚Äî not surprised? üòè).</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the original topic morphed thanks to a conversation with a friend, then expanded a little at work, and finally snowballed into a full-on get-it-out-of-my-system rant with my sister. Now? I‚Äôm sealing the deal with this post and moving on (metaphorically, anyway) ü™Ñ‚ú®</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\" href=\"#the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\">\n  </a>\n  The dream (and the reality that showed up)\n</h2>\n\n<p>For a lot of us, remote work was always the dream. Morning meetings in PJs (or the occasional stand-up in bed ‚Äî ‚úã guilty!), zero traffic, quiet when you need it, and the freedom to yell at the code as loud as you want without getting weird side-eyes. Best of all: SFW only applies if the mic is on. ‚ú® Pretty spectacular!</p>\n\n<p>When COVID first hit, it was chaos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate jobs flipping to remote overnight.</li>\n<li>Scrambling for tools to connect.</li>\n<li>Bandwidth collapses when everyone in the house tried video calls at once</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚òéÔ∏è Or my personal back-to-DSL nightmare that never had a chance from the start...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We got through it, though. We basically went from ‚Äúhow do I unmute this thing?‚Äù to running three apps, two VPNs, and a custom Slack bot before breakfast. We found new best practices. Some went back to the office and thrived there (üëã to all my polar opposites), others stayed fully remote, but we all learned a little something along the way.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-generational-gap-problem\" href=\"#the-generational-gap-problem\">\n  </a>\n  The \"Generational Gap\" Problem üåç\n</h2>\n\n<p>This isn‚Äôt about age ‚Äî it‚Äôs the fundamental expectations at work that highlight certain stereotypes (for me, anyway). I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z‚Äìstyle of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though ‚Äî you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem? Most of us were raised with this model guiding the way. So, it takes a little more deliberate effort to let it go. ü§è </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Yes ‚Äî I looked it up.

It‚Äôs about setting the right expectations ‚Äî for yourself, for your teammates, and for everyone else who interacts with you. These next sections are the things I do daily to keep projects moving, avoid burnout, and make sure I‚Äôm not accidentally the reason someone else‚Äôs day gets derailed. üöÇ</p>\n\n<p>So, whether you're a new dev, been at the job a while, or are just dev-adjacent ‚Äî here's my simple list of impactful ways to manage your time across time zones, without disrupting your team in the process.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-your-time-is-golden\" href=\"#1-your-time-is-golden\">\n  </a>\n  1. Your time is golden ‚è±Ô∏èü•á\n</h2>\n\n<p>No one can do their best work when they‚Äôre exhausted, overworked, and stuck on a ‚Äúfive-minute fix‚Äù for four hours. Your calendar can save you from both burnout and rabbit holes ‚Äî especially as you get promoted and meetings start eating into your dev time. If it‚Äôs not scheduled from start to finish, you‚Äôre probably underusing it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Set and share your work hours.</strong> Whether you‚Äôre 6 AM‚Äì2 PM or 11 AM‚Äì7 PM, make it visible in Outlook, Slack, and anywhere else your team interacts.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be selective with meetings.</strong> Accept what‚Äôs essential, mark the ‚Äúmaybes‚Äù as tentative, and decline what‚Äôs not worth your time. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Got FOMO? Outlook has a setting to keep declined meetings visible so you don't need to worry about missing something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Block recurring time for routine tasks</strong>. Email/Slack replies, code reviews, lunch (don‚Äôt skip it else you‚Äôll end up eating chips over your keyboard and pretending it was a meal!). Group them in one or two daily slots instead of scattering them across the day.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Protect deep work time.</strong> Use your largest open blocks for development (that's why we're here, right?) If those time blocks are missing right now, then go out a week or two in the future and schedule them <em>now</em>, before your calendar fills up again.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>End meetings early by default.</strong> If you‚Äôre the organizer, set them to finish 5‚Äì10 minutes before the hour. That buffer is gold for clearing quick messages before diving back in!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üç≥ Or, if you‚Äôre like me, raiding the cabinets for something that will cook itself in under a minute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal here isn‚Äôt to be rigid ‚Äî it‚Äôs to <strong>set boundaries</strong>. Once your workday is over, shut it down. Literally! Save your spot, leave a note-to-self for tomorrow, and log off without the guilt and go do literally anything else!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> Have trouble walking away with things still to do?

They‚Äôd worked fine across several projects ‚Äî until I broke them out into separate modules. Suddenly, Copilot switched from helpful answers to just summarizing its entire conversation history, no matter what I asked. üò°ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>\n\n<p>So I went back to basics, commenting out nearly everything in the prompt and adding back small sections one at a time. Eventually, I found the culprit: a single instruction forcing Copilot to re-read its whole history, flooding the context window and making it summarize the past instead of the changes. üòµ‚Äçüí´</p>\n\n<p>Even after finding the strange trigger, I didn‚Äôt really understand <em>why</em> it broke things. Cue ChatGPT‚Äôs helpful ‚Äúexplain like I‚Äôm five‚Äù walkthrough of what was happening behind the scenes (later confirmed with Copilot‚Äôs debug logs). Once I removed that one line, everything worked like normal again. üåà</p>\n\n<p>And that‚Äôs the <em>real</em> lesson: Copilot ‚Äî or any AI assistant ‚Äî is just another tool in your toolbox. When it starts acting up or giving weird results, don‚Äôt panic. Debug it the same way you‚Äôd debug any stubborn code or logic bug: one step at a time. üòâ</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"metaoptimize-your-prompts\" href=\"#metaoptimize-your-prompts\">\n  </a>\n  Meta-Optimize Your Prompts ü§ñü§ùü§ñ\n</h2>\n\n<p>Still not satisfied?

You don‚Äôt need anything fancy ‚Äî no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.</p>\n\n<p>Do you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I‚Äôve been there). Write a prompt for that!</p>\n\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter <em>what</em> you try ‚Äî the real goal is to see if you can supply <strong>all the info Copilot needs</strong> to get the job done in one go.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: GPT models are <em>especially bad</em> at immediate execution. They‚Äôll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely <strong>not</strong> you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Feeling brave? Try your luck with <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. It‚Äôs a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once? (I‚Äôll get into all the quirks of Coding Agent in a future post ‚Äî promise!)</p>\n\n<p>Just know that reusable prompts are built on this same logic ‚Äî a single message that defines <em>everything</em> needed to complete a task from start to finish.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Quick reminder: Copilot is 100% worth <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trying out in Insiders</a>. IntelliJ still owns Java, no question ‚Äî but you‚Äôre missing out on a lot of Copilot‚Äôs best tricks if you haven‚Äôt made the jump. ü´∂</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"reusable-prompts-overview\" href=\"#reusable-prompts-overview\">\n  </a>\n  Reusable Prompts Overview üß∞\n</h2>\n\n<p>Quick recap from last week: A reusable prompt is a combination of an instruction (how to act) and a step-by-step guide. The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>\n<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>\n<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done ‚Äî nothing more.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\" href=\"#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\">\n  </a>\n  Personal Guide to Prompting ‚Äî <strong>PRIOR</strong> üß≠\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let‚Äôs cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering.

That was the sum total of my initial intent.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"fast-forward\" href=\"#fast-forward\">\n  </a>\n  Fast forward\n</h2>\n\n<p>I somehow ended up with <strong>actual people followers</strong> (you know ‚Äî <em>real people</em>, not bots!).

Eventually, I‚Äôll get them back to Confluence where they were supposed to be originally anyway (although this is definitely <em>way more fun</em>)! ü§©</p>\n\n<p>So, sincerely ‚Äî thank you to everyone who‚Äôs encouraged or supported me along the way.

And even though Dev.to is super casual, I didn‚Äôt want to start shouting into the void at random without first setting a <em>tiny</em> bit of structure. ü§è</p>\n\n<p>Plus, I work better under pressure.

You can expect the useful, the weird, the frustrating, the dramatic ‚Äî and everything in between. That could be lunchtime in London, dinnertime in Delhi, or ‚Äúoops I overslept (<em>again</em>)‚Äù on the East Coast. ‚è∞</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> It‚Äôs not that I <em>can‚Äôt</em> schedule them at the exact same time every week... it just physically hurts to not sprinkle in a little \"unpredictable\" (welcome to my brain!)

There's not much to cover here after you know they exist and where to find them. Unless you're making friends with every MCP server and already met your \"128 selected tool\" limit, there's not much reason to mess with them much. Just make sure they're all selected and available for Copilot to execute when prompted and you're set.¬†</p>\n\n<p>Here's my personal top-5 built-in tools, that somehow <em>always</em>¬†manage to sneak into any reusable prompt I write:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#changes</code>¬†gives Copilot the ability to see a git diff¬†for your workspace</li>\n<li>\n<code>#codebase</code>¬†all-season access to your repo (and sometimes should be more targeted, but when in doubt this is a good start!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runTests</code>¬†is just what it sounds like and let's Copilot execute any part or all of your test suite</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runInTerminal</code>¬†is the basic run-of-the-mill access to Copilot's very own integrated terminal (separate from yours!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#editFiles</code>¬†is the tool Copilot needs to make any changes within your repo. If you're expecting Agent Mode to start implementing features, you're going to need this!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> In Agent mode, click the wrench (Configure Tools) at the bottom of Copilot Chat to pick exactly which tools Copilot can use.

The truth is, it‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs fault - least of all your own.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-truth-about-psychosis\" href=\"#the-truth-about-psychosis\">\n  </a>\n  The Truth about Psychosis\n</h2>\n\n<p>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders typically first appear in teens and young adults, but that‚Äôs not because of the latest tech trend.</p>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>‚Äú50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.‚Äù</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been true long before anyone worried about AI, TikTok, or even Pac-Man.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>teams</em> of experts actively researching what causes psychosis - technology is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle that includes genetics, environment, stress, trauma, and yes, sometimes technology use (in many forms).</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2817594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2024 study</a> found only a <strong>modest link</strong> between higher computer use in mid-teen years and later psychotic experiences, and even that was mostly explained by other risk factors (mental health and social challenges were present <em>before</em> the high computer use). No clear ‚Äúcause and effect,‚Äù just a reminder that life is complicated and brains even more so.</p>\n\n<p>This is a serious medical topic. Blaming TV, games, the internet, or AI for psychosis is the same tired playbook people have used for decades, and it only makes it harder for people to ask for help. Mental illness is never as simple as a single cause, and fear-mongering or finger-pointing helps no one.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-this-is-important-to-me\" href=\"#why-this-is-important-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Why This Is Important to Me\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"those-closest-to-me\" href=\"#those-closest-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Those Closest to Me\n</h3>\n\n<p>I grew up with someone in my household who had an untreated mental health condition. It wasn‚Äôt schizophrenia, but it deeply shaped my world from my earliest memories. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù - it was simply normal for me. Years later, after I was grown, they finally received help. I wish I could say it was a storybook turnaround. There were good stretches, and some not-so-good ones. Did all those years without support play a role in how things are now? I can‚Äôt say for sure - but I know it didn‚Äôt help.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"my-own-journey\" href=\"#my-own-journey\">\n  </a>\n  My Own Journey\n</h3>\n\n<p>I was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition in my early twenties (and I‚Äôm always willing to talk about it privately if anyone needs support - just reach out). Honestly, I felt ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù long before I ever got the diagnosis. I couldn‚Äôt quite name it, and for a long time I just assumed I was ‚Äúoff‚Äù in some way. Admitting there might be a problem took a <em>long</em> time; actually seeking help took <em>even longer</em> and was often inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until college, when I signed up for free counseling sessions (for reasons I can‚Äôt even remember - probably thanks to a sibling who worked in the office), that things started to shift. My counselor, Maggie, was the definition of approachable and probably saved my life more than once. One of the first things she did was encourage more frequent sessions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A quick PSA:</strong> Finding the right counselor or therapist can be pure luck - or it can take a lot of searching. If you tried once and it didn‚Äôt click, don‚Äôt give up. Your ‚ÄúMaggie‚Äù is out there, but you‚Äôll never meet them if you don‚Äôt keep looking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with counseling for a long time (in addition to other treatment). Life eventually took us in different directions, and it hasn‚Äôt always been as easy since, but I learned how to show up for myself and talk about it. Some days I‚Äôm better at it than others, but overall, I‚Äôm a happy, healthy adult - and, most importantly, I finally <em>feel</em> normal.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"ripple-effects\" href=\"#ripple-effects\">\n  </a>\n  Ripple Effects\n</h3>\n\n<p>Out of respect for my family‚Äôs privacy, I won‚Äôt go deep here. But as an adult, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how mental health issues can affect not just individuals, but entire families - even those who don‚Äôt live under the same roof. The big lesson: it‚Äôs not just okay to talk about mental health and seek help - <strong>it‚Äôs essential</strong>. The person in my life who struggled is doing much better now, thanks to a treatment plan that worked for them and continued care.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\" href=\"#be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\">\n  </a>\n  Be Part of the Solution to Mental Health\n</h2>\n\n<p>Mental health struggles - crisis or not - are <em>never</em> caused by one thing, and they‚Äôre never solved by one thing. It takes understanding, openness, and the willingness to address tough topics. Spreading rumors or horror stories like ‚ÄúChatGPT made her crazy!‚Äù only hurts people who are already suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please, be part of the solution. Share. Talk. Show up. Somebody needs it more than you know.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs focus on compassion, understanding, and <em>real</em> support for those struggling - not easy answers or scapegoats. üíõ</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üõ°Ô∏è This post was created with compassion, understanding, and the help of ChatGPT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",

I‚Äôll share what part‚Äôs have actually been working at some point, but so far the answer is \"not a lot\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have some ideas, so it's not a lost cause yet!

You remember in my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">nightmare story</a> I mentioned doing some pretty out-there things to get my hands on the enterprise version of the Copilot license? Well, apparently, if you exhaust 100% of your premium requests in less than 4 days <em>AND</em> make sure your boss is <em>instantly</em> aware of the problem - you know, so they understand the <strong>true gravity</strong> of the matter in real-time (which is around 7 PM on a Saturday) - work is suddenly more willing to share üòá </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"chatgpt\" href=\"#chatgpt\">\n  </a>\n  ChatGPT\n</h3>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve been a long-time user for quite some time, but I wanted to call this guy out - and more specifically, exactly <em>how</em> ChatGPT is involved in all my posts. While Copilot is the topic of most everything I write, ChatGPT is usually busy behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm sure the obsession will wear off eventually... maybe... oh hell, probably not. Never mind! üòÖ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"gemini\" href=\"#gemini\">\n  </a>\n  Gemini\n</h3>\n\n<p>Gemini and I aren‚Äôt talking much right now - which has everything to do with the beta install I put on my Android before fully realizing what Google had <em>actually</em> done with all the hands-free tools the non-generative assistant used to handle (spoiler: not a damn thing is the answer üò°). So, for now, Gemini‚Äôs riding the bench.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt last long.

I‚Äôve almost perfected a prompt that will keep the primary image content vertically \"squished\" towards the center, so the aspect ratio will match suggested size guidelines after I crop it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today's image is a test in full-size, but it was to good to mess with much, especially considering all the personalities it gave me along the way. ü•∏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Seems like either all of the training data was a perfect square OR more likely it's been trained to output specific sizes and my attempts at a compromise violate that plan.</p></li>\n<li><p>I have a designated project for the banner images and roughly half the time I give it a prompt and just use whatever it spits out at me. The other half, it‚Äôs either not at all usable or it‚Äôs <em>so terrible</em> I really don‚Äôt want to share it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It will take some work for me to go through those, but yes - I at least save them. üîí</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gimp isn‚Äôt AI, but it's my go-to for anything image related. Up until a little bit ago I <strong>thought</strong> I was saving all images with meta tags that included the ‚ÄúGenerated by/Edited with‚Äù comment, but either it‚Äôs just different on this computer or they‚Äôre not really being saved like I thought. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm gonna work on that before next post though - those should definitely be there! üèÅ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"blog-posts\" href=\"#blog-posts\">\n  </a>\n  Blog posts üí¨\n</h3>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not about to let AI write the <em>whole thing</em> for me (where‚Äôs the fun in that?), but I do rely on it a lot for drafts and edits. Just in case anyone‚Äôs wondering how the whole process actually happens, here it is - step by step:</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>ONE. <strong>Idea</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I‚Äôll literally have no idea what I'm going to talk about until I actually start writing. Other times, I‚Äôve been saving ideas for weeks! There‚Äôs really no rhyme or reason to this, so I just go with it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seems like now that I'm actually in a groove, these \"off-the-usual-topic\" (read <em>Copilot</em>) posts are more frequent, too. üèéÔ∏è</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>TWO. <strong>Draft</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IS 100% ME</strong> - sometimes I‚Äôm lazy and will dictate to ChatGPT (occasionally Gemini, but we‚Äôre on a hiatus right now anyway), but I have an instruction that says specifically do not change anything until I tell you I‚Äôm ready to start editing. </p>\n\n<p>So for the majority of the week (and more-than-occasionally late the night before ü§ê) I‚Äôm working on a relatively cohesive unit to cover a specific <em>something</em> (\"topic\" is usually a stretch, at this point). Typically, the draft version is roughly twice as long as the final version and my posts aren‚Äôt exactly short to begin with (I know).</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>THREE. <strong>Edits</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this is where it gets a <em>little tricky</em>. I have a custom set of instructions for the blog posts, in which the majority of it is focused on two major things, in order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scan the entire post and make changes wherever needed to remove <strong>unintentional bias</strong>, and for every change you make, summarize it with examples and <strong>show me</strong> why your version is better suited. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm getting better as we go, but it‚Äôs really just a safety net so I don‚Äôt accidentally put my foot in my mouth after taking the scenic route to my point (it‚Äôs a talent).  üì∏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep my <strong>original attitude and quirks</strong> as much as possible, but not to the extent that it contradicts the first point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I already trained it a long time ago to censor me. It doesn‚Äôt even bring that part up anymore, most of the time anyway. üò∂ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FOUR. <strong>Negotiation</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really don‚Äôt have a better word for what happens during this phase, because that‚Äôs exactly what it feels like. ChatGPT took my nice story and turned it into something that I only vaguely recognize, so I‚Äôll argue that it‚Äôs <em>TOO</em> changed. </p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT argues with me that not everybody understands what a \"holler\" is and that it‚Äôs probably already too far off-topic to explain whatever contextual point I wanted to make anyway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's usually accurate, too. üò§</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FIVE. <strong>Final polish</strong></p>\n\n<p>After we have a <em>final working version</em> (cause I‚Äôm still changing it randomly), the quizzing starts for all those words I want to say, but really just cannot put my finger on or I need to convey some sort of emotion or attitude (and I‚Äôm getting sick of seeing the same emojis all the time).</p>\n\n<p>This is where the content of the blog conversation in ChatGPT pivots and I‚Äôll have it show me a random 10 emojis that could work for a particular phrase or scenario - I‚Äôll pick from there. Same with section titles and quotes, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üíø When it comes to titles, quotes, and references - it's rarely as simple as <strong>picking one</strong> from a list. Most of the time, I'll pick parts of at least three and then feed them back to ChatGPT to make coherent again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SIX. <strong>Final review</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point it‚Äôs all loaded into Dev, but I'm still reviewing repeatedly until I can make it from top to bottom without the urge to change something immediately (which can sometimes take a couple days - like this post ‚ö°Ô∏è). </p>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs typically a whole lot of page swapping (preview &gt; edit &gt; preview) until I‚Äôm finally happy with the overall version. From there, most posts get scheduled for Wednesday mornings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü™¥ Why? No reason, really - it‚Äôs more random chance. I‚Äôve tried to stay on at least a weekly schedule since I joined. If I schedule the big posts, I know I won‚Äôt accidentally miss a day. üòá</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SEVEN. <strong>Update: RAI Footer</strong></p>\n\n<p>So here‚Äôs a late-breaking update: After I stumbled onto a post over on Medium (for reasons I still can‚Äôt fully explain üôÑ), I decided to forward some of these posts there too. Turns out, Medium has a whole policy on ‚ÄúAI-generated‚Äù content ‚Äî because <em>of course</em> they do. And since I can never resist at a good debate, let‚Äôs be extra clear about how these work.</p>\n\n<p>Those ‚ÄúRAI Footers‚Äù you see at the end of each post? They‚Äôre mostly the work of ChatGPT now, spun up from my own pile of instructions. </p>\n\n<p>The usual ask:<br>\n<code>Take the main theme of this post and add a unique, fun way to say that you (the AI) helped make it happen.</code></p>\n\n<p>I always review and edit for good measure, but honestly, after ChatGPT does all the heavy lifting, it‚Äôs only fair it gets its own section. This is the AI-generated section, after all. Seems only right to give the robot its moment in the spotlight. üé©</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"tldr-the-heart-of-the-matter\" href=\"#tldr-the-heart-of-the-matter\">\n  </a>\n  TL;DR: The Heart of the Matter ü´Ä\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you‚Äôve made it this far, now you know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, I use AI - a LOT</li>\n<li>No, it doesn‚Äôt do <em>all</em> the work for me</li>\n<li>Yes, I argue with it (and sometimes lose...)</li>\n<li>No, it hasn‚Äôt taken over my personality</li>\n<li>Yes, the cover art is AI-generated\n\n<ul>\n<li>unless it‚Äôs truly hideous - those are locked in the vault!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The real secret is that all of this is <em>still me</em>!

Yes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"and-heres-the-part-everyone-asks\" href=\"#and-heres-the-part-everyone-asks\">\n  </a>\n  And here‚Äôs the part everyone asks:\n</h3>\n\n<p>Did I turn off Copilot‚Äôs blanket auto-approvals after all this?  Nope. Didn‚Äôt even consider it. But I did tighten the instructions a LOT. Copilot‚Äôs much better behaved now, and if I step away, I pause it first. Lesson learned. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Mostly</em> üòá</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"your-turn\" href=\"#your-turn\">\n  </a>\n  Your turn!\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Have you ever let Copilot (or any other AI) run wild and lived to tell the tale?</li>\n<li>Or do you have your own ‚Äúit sounded like a good idea at the time...‚Äù moment?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Drop your story in the comments, so I know I‚Äôm not the <em>only</em> one out here making epic AI messes. üôÉ</p>\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs laugh, commiserate, and maybe even learn something together!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"rai-disclaimer\" href=\"#rai-disclaimer\">\n  </a>\n  üõ°Ô∏è RAI Disclaimer\n</h3>\n\n<p>Everything I share here is my own perspective‚Äîcreated with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop.
