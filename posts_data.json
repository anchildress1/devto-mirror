But now that I'm here? I'm almost, <strong><em>almost</em></strong> too tired to even enjoy it. And because I'm a ride-or-die kind of person — either all in or over it yesterday — we're just going to dive headfirst into the shallow end. No holding back — I hope you're ready! 🛟</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"your-10minute-101-to-get-you-started-with-autonomous-ai\" href=\"#your-10minute-101-to-get-you-started-with-autonomous-ai\">\n  </a>\n  Your 10-minute 101 to get you started with autonomous AI ⏰\n</h2>\n\n<p>Honestly? there's <em>no way</em> I can cover everything about GitHub Coding Agent in one go. So, for this post 👇, we're doing the \"just enough to be dangerous\" thing. I'll hit you with the absolute must-knows, show you how to get started (in 10 minutes or less), and <em>hopefully</em>, not put you to sleep in the process (or myself!). </p>\n\n<p>My goal is to give you a \"preview teaser\" so you can go play, explore a bit, and maybe even tackle that hack time project you keep putting off. But whatever you do, <em>please</em> don't think this is your all-inclusive pass to go wild on production code. 🫡</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\" href=\"#coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\">\n  </a>\n  Coding Agent ≠ Agent Mode 🤪\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, let's get something straight right off the bat, because these names are just asking for trouble. Yes, they both have \"GitHub\" and \"Agent\" in the name. And yes, they're both powered by Claude Sonnet 4, but <strong>that's where the similarities stop.</strong> Agent Mode is for in-IDE use, a bit like a sidekick who waits for you to tell it what to do next. Coding Agent? It's the whole show — a full-on autonomous workflow that runs on its own dedicated VM. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Custom instructions and prompt techniques are the secret sauce here. This is true for any Gen-AI tool, but it's <em>especially critical</em> with Coding Agent, which will just keep guessing until it runs out of steam or thinks the job is done. Don't let it run wild without a map!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don't worry, Coding Agent is designed with safety in mind. It's an incredibly contained, safe version of the \"autonomous coding\" experiment I ran on my own a while back. I spent 45 days arguing with a thing I wired up on my laptop, and I worked harder then than on any other project I've built before or since. </p>\n\n<p>Why? Because I didn't want to just listen to what people were saying about AI — I <em>needed</em> to see it for myself. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 And that, my friends, is why I'm here volunteering as your guide. If you get stuck, hit me up! I've probably tried it that way plus three other insane ideas before I found one that mostly worked 🙃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"safety-first-chaos-second\" href=\"#safety-first-chaos-second\">\n  </a>\n  Safety First, Chaos Second 🛡️\n</h2>\n\n<p>I know, I know... I just spent a whole paragraph telling you how much I love this thing, and now I'm gonna give you the other half of the equation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm all for pushing a new tool to its absolute limit, just to see what happens. It reminds me of my favorite Hunter S. Thompson quote — which I slightly mangled to get a SFW version — but the core truth remains: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you find a new, beautiful wave, <strong>the tendency is to push it as far as you can.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, how far can you push GitHub Coding Agent? Pretty far, but there are a few things you need to know first.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\" href=\"#1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\">\n  </a>\n  1. Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You <em>Should</em>\n</h3>\n\n<p>This tool can absolutely excel, but it requires the right prompt, instructions, and general setup. If you're looking to dive into some legacy code to see what's what, or maybe you want a safe playground to mess around in, then this is your guy! </p>\n\n<p>But if you're thinking about using it to fix a production bug, especially when you're on a tight deadline, you probably (aka absolutely, most definitely) want to reconsider. Treat this as a \"learn how this works\" project, not a \"throw it at a problem and hope\" situation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-your-prompt-is-everything\" href=\"#2-your-prompt-is-everything\">\n  </a>\n  2. Your Prompt is Everything\n</h3>\n\n<p>The effectiveness of your instructions and prompt is multiplied exponentially by the complexity of your task. A great, well-thought-out set of instructions that you've carefully tweaked over weeks? Coding Agent will do fine. But if you spend 10 minutes throwing a few sentences together just to see what happens, don't be surprised when you come back to a haunted house where your beautiful little cottage of a codebase used to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 It is an agent and when an agent doesn't know something, <em>they guess</em>. <strong>That's just what they do.</strong> The only thing more dangerous than an AI off the rails and hallucinating is the fact that you just turned it loose on your code all by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-its-actually-good-for\" href=\"#what-its-actually-good-for\">\n  </a>\n  What It's Actually Good For ✨\n</h2>\n\n<p>After all those warnings, I need to make it crystal clear: <strong>this tool is not dangerous.</strong> It runs on its own virtual machine and executes safely within GitHub Actions. It has a limited environment and only has access to what you explicitly give it. </p>\n\n<p>It <strong>always creates a new branch</strong>, which is a key safety feature. You can't get around it, even if you try. Trust me, I was annoyed, but the safety is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you realistically use this for? Here are some of my favorite real-world use cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation:</strong> Nothing has worked better for me than using Coding Agent to dive deep into a codebase and spit out test-ready use cases or a handful of detailed system architecture Mermaid diagrams. You set it loose, go get a coffee, and come back to 7-8 pages of detailed, well-researched use cases ready to be plugged in.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing:</strong> This one's a little controversial for a test-driven development purist like me, <em>but</em>... when you're on a deadline and you just need to get things done, you can write the code and have Coding Agent go write the tests. It's not a perfect solution, but a pull request with 28/30 passing tests is way better than one with zero tests at all. 🤫🫣</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project Planning:</strong> Got a big initiative coming up? Instead of spending a week flipping through pages of dead code to figure out how it used to work, you can have Coding Agent do the heavy lifting and print out a nifty little report when it's done. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\" href=\"#how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\">\n  </a>\n  How to Get Started in 5 Minutes or Less ⏱️\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the interest of time and keeping this digestible, I'm going to give you the basics that will work 100% of the time. We'll dig in on some more tools next week.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub has made this incredibly accessible now. You can find the new <strong>agents panel</strong> button on just about every page in GitHub: both on the home page and within any repository.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2\" alt=\"GitHub new agents panel view to access Coding Agent\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"669\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Select the Repository and Base Branch:</strong> Choose the repo and the branch you want Coding Agent to work from. It will <em>always</em> create its own branch, so don't worry about selecting <code>main</code> (or a trunk-based development model) if that's your primary branch. I'm telling you, you can <em>try</em> to tell it not to create a branch, but it's not going to listen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Craft Your Prompt:</strong> This is <em>not</em> your typical conversational prompting. Coding Agent <em>will keep guessing</em> until it reaches what it considers to be \"complete.\" Save yourself the headache and give it all the info up front.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Submit Your Request:</strong> Every time you hit send, it's considered one premium request. This is why it's so important to be concise and provide all the context it needs upfront.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> To save premium requests when reviewing Copilot's PR, go to the diff page and leave all your <code>@copilot</code> comments as pending. When you're ready, submit them all at once, and it will only cost you <em>one request</em> whether you leave two comments or 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"a-final-warning-about-responsibility\" href=\"#a-final-warning-about-responsibility\">\n  </a>\n  A Final Warning About Responsibility 😈\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, one last thing. I have to let this sink in: </p>\n\n<p><strong>If it's <em>your</em> prompt, it's <em>your code</em>. Period.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you go out and give a prompt to Copilot, ignore it for 30 minutes, do a half-hearted review, approve your own pull request, override the protection rules to push it to main, and then the codebase burns down... that's <strong>not</strong> Copilot's fault. That's your fault. Your prompt, your branch, your code, AI or not.</p>\n\n<p>So, be aware, be smart, and <em>please</em> don't use this as an excuse to ignore the basics. Start small with documentation or tests, and work your way up.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"lets-get-real\" href=\"#lets-get-real\">\n  </a>\n  Let's Get Real 🤨\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you tried GitHub Coding Agent yet?

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been meaning to write this since I first saw Medium's post on Friday — but, you know, life happens. So a little late, but I wanted to share. You tell me — <em>am I the crazy one here?</em> 🫤</p>\n\n<p>👆 Also, River has shown up in a few posts already — the Leonardo reimagining of my blog character. She’s still missing some key features (training tokens are tapped out until the month resets), but you get the idea. 😆 Expect a couple more tweaks coming soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Friday was my chill day (rare, but they do happen) and I noticed somebody had followed me on Medium. Which is funny, because I’d already canceled my membership — it just hadn’t expired yet. Five bucks a month isn’t exactly breaking the bank, so I thought, fine, maybe I’ll toss a few posts over there alongside LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>That <em>was</em> the plan. Until I landed on Medium’s homepage and saw this headline:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/blog/we-want-your-feedback-how-can-writers-use-ai-to-tell-human-stories-eb9dee926f2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“We want your feedback: how can writers use AI to tell human stories?”</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Perfect hook, right? Except two scrolls later I was fuming like I was just called in for a rollback on a Friday night. 😡</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-fine-print\" href=\"#the-fine-print\">\n  </a>\n  The Fine Print 🔍\n</h2>\n\n<p>By the time you dig through the post, the documentation, and the linked policies, the message is clear:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AI as spellcheck? Totally fine. ✅ </li>\n<li>ChatGPT outlines and fact-checks? Approved. ✅ </li>\n<li>Anything more (drafting, editing, all other AI assistance)? ❌ \n\n<ul>\n<li>You’re officially outside their definition of “writer.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>And if you <em>do</em> dare use AI, you have to declare it at the very top of your post, within the first two paragraphs, and again on every image. Metadata doesn’t count.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you lean on AI for anything beyond grammar, you can write on Medium, but you’ll never get boosted, partnered, or featured. You <em>can</em> post, but you’re standing outside in the rain while everyone else gets a table inside. 🍽️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-it-feels-off\" href=\"#why-it-feels-off\">\n  </a>\n  Why It Feels Off 🤔\n</h2>\n\n<p>Look, I get it. Nobody wants a feed full of unedited AI sludge. I’m not trying to game the system either. I’m not chasing claps or badges. I write because it’s fun, because I need a break from code, and because I have opinions the world clearly needs to hear. 😉 </p>\n\n<p><strong>AI doesn’t erase my voice — it sharpens it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So calling everything in between spellcheck and prompt-posting off limits? No appeal, no nuance, just blanket exclusion? <em>That’s</em> where I’m lost.</p>\n\n<p>Developers talk nonstop about AI. Colleges too. It’s a huge, messy, <strong>important conversation</strong>. And Medium — the site that prides itself on being the “top blogging platform” — takes the most stereotypical, exclusionary stance possible. ChatGPT usually gets painted as the villain here, but really, it’s just the stand-in for all the tools that make the work easier.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, it feels less like quality control and more like gatekeeping. Nuance would’ve made sense. Even a \"don't automate your blog posts\" sounds great. <em>This?</em> It's like they skipped gray completely and went straight to Twilight Zone monochrome. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"my-reply\" href=\"#my-reply\">\n  </a>\n  My Reply ✍️\n</h2>\n\n<p>You know I couldn’t resist. 🤷‍♀️ Yes — I dropped a response directly on Medium's front door, and linked to it right in their own discussion.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Confession time: when I first started writing this post, I was <strong>mad</strong>. Not mildly irritated, not “eh, I’ll just wait for the next patch” annoyed. I mean genuinely fed up with Copilot, ChatGPT, and everything GPT-5 in general. And if I make it to the end of this post in one piece, maybe you'll understand why.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-funeral\" href=\"#the-funeral\">\n  </a>\n  The Funeral 👻\n</h2>\n\n<p>First, let me start this out by stating that OpenAI has officially buried the excuse that GPT can’t code. We had the funeral over the weekend. All its friends were invited. Laid to rest. Cremation done. Trees planted. Memorial service complete. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s done — GPT-5 can code.</strong> Full stop.</p>\n\n<p>There's no room for debate. No more hacks with pages of instructions or GPT hanging out on the sidelines because it's busy staring at the plan. OpenAI <em>nailed it</em> with an absolutely solid model.</p>\n\n<p>Plus VS Code's release came with some more experimental features that turns the already-solid GPT-5 in to a “send a prompt, make a plan, deep thinking, Implementation Specialist at your service” experience. That being said, I still haven't had nearly enough time with the full model yet.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Why, you ask? Because my brilliant self left my personal account logged in while working last week. That account? It's the cheap $10 one. I burned through <em>all</em> my premium requests before I even noticed. 🫥</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So yes, GPT-5 (the real one) passed its early test runs beautifully — small to medium features, planning and implementation, no complaints. But the deep dive it deserves? That’s still coming — stay tuned.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What was I doing instead of the GPT-5 deep dive? Playing the lead role in the horror story of Full House starring Kimmy Gibbler and the never-ending wall of text. 🧗‍♀️😑</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"duct-tape-please\" href=\"#duct-tape-please\">\n  </a>\n  Duct Tape, Please? 🤐\n</h2>\n\n<p>GPT-5-Mini is not bad. Let’s clear that up. For small, targeted context? For quick features? For implementing a clearly defined task with accuracy and precision? <strong>It’s great.</strong> Honestly. Kimmy Gibbler is a surprisingly solid coder.</p>\n\n<p>But the output.<br>\nOh. My. God. The. Output. 🫨😲😵‍💫</p>\n\n<p>I'm talking about <em>walls and walls</em> of text. Waterfalls of “look at me, I wrote a test!” status updates flooding my chat window like it's trying to set a world record. No, Kimmy, I don’t need a play-by-play novella about the journey you took to create a three-line function. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Sure — I started out at least <em>trying</em> to skim what it was saying. But my sanity didn't last long into that battle. Seriously, if I read another scroll of verbose rambling I might have retreated to some dark corner until next Tuesday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-standoff\" href=\"#the-standoff\">\n  </a>\n  The Standoff\n</h3>\n\n<p>At one point, it got <strong>so bad</strong> that I set up a stand-off. I told GPT something along the lines of, “Go check on that workflow. If it works, give me a checkmark. <em>That’s it.</em> If you say anything else, I’m turning you off forever.”</p>\n\n<p>It complied. One lonely ✅ appeared.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcsdkwafhugbsp1r1ic3u.png%3Fv%3D2\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcsdkwafhugbsp1r1ic3u.png%3Fv%3D2\" alt=\"GPT-5-Mini Stand-off Victory\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"798\" height=\"182\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Victory? Maybe. For about thirty seconds. Then the rambling resumed. 🤦‍♀️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s what I didn’t realize at first: I had also turned on every single experimental preview feature in VS Code. That’s my usual routine — release notes drop, I’m flipping switches left and right.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>thought</em> I was enabling a neat little planning checklist feature. Which to be fair, I <em>did</em> do that... I also omitted its counterpart to internalize that chatter. Which meant the Mini chaos doubled — and nothing I added to the prompts or instructions made a bit of difference. 😫</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I even tried to tame it with a new <strong>Principal Pragmatist</strong> chat mode. Didn’t matter. Kimmy kept talking. Nonstop floods of text testing my sanity at every turn. Thanks, Kimmy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"leatherface-joins-the-party\" href=\"#leatherface-joins-the-party\">\n  </a>\n  Leatherface Joins the Party\n</h2>\n\n<p>GitHub Copilot is only part of the equation, though. Because just when I thought I’d found a rhythm there, here comes ChatGPT starring as Leatherface, chainsaw roaring, doing a happy dance all over my carefully constructed blog draft. Shredding paragraphs. Scattering virtual scraps across the room. Obliterating what had been a perfectly flowing system of prompts and edits.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I mean, this post normally would have taken me a couple of hours. Instead, three days later, I'm <em>still</em> wrestling Leatherface for control of my own sentences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commands escalated. From firm. To censored. To questioning life choices. And finally, full-on ultimatum. I even took a few hours detour with Gemini — proof that I'm willing to go to war with an LLM over word count. (I'm also <em>still</em> losing that battle!)</p>\n\n<p>The moral of the story? While GPT-5 is a great coder — it is <strong>more than terrible</strong> at creative writing. So, why do we have a single model replacement for 2 completely different problems, OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"where-we-are-now\" href=\"#where-we-are-now\">\n  </a>\n  Where We Are Now\n</h2>\n\n<p>So where does that leave things?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GPT-5: rock-solid coder, worthy of the “Implementation Specialist” title, but still waiting for its fair turn in the spotlight with me.</li>\n<li>Mini: great in short bursts, but <strong>do not</strong> let her narrate. Especially not with <em>every</em> experimental feature flipped on. Else plan for duct tape.</li>\n<li>ChatGPT: still a chainsaw in a library butchering my every attempt at creative writing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And me? Still here. Still writing. Still dragging you through the chaos with me, because apparently this is how I process the fact that we had a funeral for “GPT can’t code” and I celebrated it by duct-taping Gibbler and dodging Leatherface.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like a victory, right? Well, sort of. At least the tombstone is carved. 🫶👻</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"responsible-ai-footnote\" href=\"#responsible-ai-footnote\">\n  </a>\n  🛡️ Responsible AI Footnote\n</h2>\n\n<p>All opinions here are my own. Real-world AI results depend on setup, context, and the occasional experimental toggle you <em>probably</em> shouldn’t have turned on in the first place. Test responsibly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪓 Approved by Leatherface (ChatGPT).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>First of all — thank you. 🙏</p>\n\n<p>For real. This community has been nothing but encouraging, and it was a huge surprise to end up in the <strong>top seven</strong> last week. I didn’t expect it, but it’s appreciated more than you know. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"tldr\" href=\"#tldr\">\n  </a>\n  TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you're looking for a quick and efficient way to increase traffic to your DevTo blog posts (or anywhere else with a little tweaking)? Try my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10-minute DevTo crawly mirror</a>. Here's how it works:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Clone the repo</strong>. Enter your DevTO username as an env variable in the repo. Delete the existing <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scheduled GHA Workflow</strong> off-peak or manually trigger.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Static HTML</strong> hosted via GitHub Pages</li>\n<li><strong>Canonical back to Dev</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"starting-with-nothing\" href=\"#starting-with-nothing\">\n  </a>\n  Starting With Nothing 🔦\n</h2>\n\n<p>So, this entire thing started with a conversation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 About what? I honestly can’t remember now — Copilot, debugging, something in that ballpark. Doesn’t matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But somehow — like so many of my rabbit holes — it mutated and morphed until I wasn't exactly at the same place I had started. I really can't explain the series of events that happened after that. I blame it on <em>curiosity</em> more than anything, but I did the one thing I swore I'd never do: I asked ChatGPT to do a quick search — pull one of my posts.</p>\n\n<p>And... <strong>nothing</strong>. Like the post didn’t exist. 🕳️</p>\n\n<p>Okay. 😅 Fine. Let’s take a step back. Next, I went straight to Google and typed the same thing. Results were <em>better</em> — sure. Scroll, scroll, scroll... and <strong>there</strong> it was. My post. Not at the top, but alive. Win. 😏</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Real talk</strong>: Do I care about being #1? No, not in the slightest. Honestly, I love my invisibility bubble — keeps things peaceful in my corner of the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But here’s the thing: invisibility and AI don’t mix. Because when I need an answer, I don’t open a browser anymore. I yell at my phone: “Hey Google!” Or I pop into ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>\n\n<p>If my posts don’t show up there, they might as well not even exist. 🫤</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\" href=\"#d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\">\n  </a>\n  Déjà Vu 🔮\n</h2>\n\n<p>So I’m now blessed with the knowledge that my posts are basically hiding out in the Room of Requirement — you know it’s there, but only if the stars align. And <strong>that</strong> makes it hard to share the advice I keep repeating everywhere else that will listen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“Yes, you can use it for debugging.”</li>\n<li>“Of course it can generate the tests.”</li>\n<li>“Docs? Oh my god, PLEASE let it write the docs.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the time I’ve said it for the fifth time, it feels like I’m stuck in reruns.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Honestly, some days I feel like I need a theme song: “Previously, on AI Adventures with Ashley...” 🎵🎶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure. <em>Sometimes</em>, I let AI run wild (it's more fun that way!). My Coding Agent kills it with documentation. I even built a chat mode that plays architect — reverse engineers a repo and spits out mermaid diagrams like it’s dealing cards in Vegas. That one runs in GitHub Actions, then opens a PR, and I'll merge once everything checks out.</p>\n\n<p>But the everyday stuff? It’s not dramatic. It’s small instructions, nudges, prompts. Rinse, repeat, <em>coffee</em>, repeat again. ☕️ It's slow, incremental improvements to be just a little better than yesterday. 🤏</p>\n\n<p>And what drives me absolutely up the wall? The extremes. Either “AI will replace every dev tomorrow” or “AI is useless, don’t bother.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Honestly</strong>, it’s like sitting court-side at Quidditch — the little guy zips across the field so fast you think you’ve finally caught up, but nope. He’s already off to something else... and it’s almost always completely wrong, too. 😅</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"writing-it-down\" href=\"#writing-it-down\">\n  </a>\n  Writing It Down 📕\n</h2>\n\n<p>So my solution: write it down. That’s what most of these blog posts are. Whatever comes up that week — whether it’s me digging, someone else asking, or just another repeated question — if I haven’t covered it already, give me a week. I'll get there.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this system? Instead of explaining everything for the tenth time, I can just say: “Glad you’re trying this. I think my blog might help — here’s the link. Let me know if you’ve got questions.”</p>\n\n<p>See. Simple, right? 🙂‍↕️ But even <em>that</em> wasn’t enough, because usually by the time I arrived on scene things were in somewhat of a state already. Mostly because what AI <em>was</em> helping with had a knowledge cut-off of January and everything else is wading through Microsoft or GitHub docs looking for any little nibble.</p>\n\n<p>So I set out to find a way to make my DevTo posts truly crawly — <em>without</em>  Dante's DevOps nightmares playing on repeat at the top of every hour. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Sure, I <em>briefly</em> considered the real solution — custom website, full hosting stack, the whole front-end shebang. But I'm a backend engineer for a reason! My personal site is designed for APIs not MUI. I'd really prefer to keep it that way!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-hack-in-action\" href=\"#the-hack-in-action\">\n  </a>\n  The Hack in Action 💻\n</h2>\n\n<p>So, I did what any other respectable developer would do with an extra 15 minutes and spark of an idea: I hacked it. What do you get with 3 hours, a solid round of \"will OCD win again?\" and ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot tag team special? Exactly zero upkeep — mission accomplished. ✅<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>GHA cron → Dev API → static HTML → GitHub Pages → robots.txt\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it.

I did happen across this tidbit in the 15 minutes of research I did on the subject. I'm still testing this to see what the impact looks like, but seems promising. 😇</p>\n\n<p>In your DevTo settings, you have the option to use the current rich-text markdown editor we all know and love <em>or</em>, you can switch to the legacy version. It's kind of an all or nothing deal, as far as I can tell. So you either have it <em>everywhere</em> or <em>nowhere</em>. But, it does give you access to the yaml front-matter for your posts and the ability to define your own brief description instead of relying on the first ~160 words you post. </p>\n\n<p>It seems like an awfully lot of work though, and I've kinda gotten used to the new markdown buttons (that I never use). So my solution? Let's just hit buttons until I find one that works. 🤓</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F43h29r9zbde4lnr4fy3u.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F43h29r9zbde4lnr4fy3u.png\" alt=\"DevTo Frontmatter for Post\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"262\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"whats-mine-is-yours\" href=\"#whats-mine-is-yours\">\n  </a>\n  What's Mine is Yours 🍀\n</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re after more profile views or just tired of repeating yourself like me, this trick works.

Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use <code>applyTo</code> in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in <code>.github/instructions/database.instructions.md</code> instead of the default file and add the <code>applyTo</code>. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">src/main/java/dao/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># My Custom Database Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\" href=\"#the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\">\n  </a>\n  The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\" href=\"#1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\">\n  </a>\n  1.

I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z–style of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though — you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem? Most of us were raised with this model guiding the way. So, it takes a little more deliberate effort to let it go. 🤏 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes — I looked it up.

It’s about setting the right expectations — for yourself, for your teammates, and for everyone else who interacts with you. These next sections are the things I do daily to keep projects moving, avoid burnout, and make sure I’m not accidentally the reason someone else’s day gets derailed. 🚂</p>\n\n<p>So, whether you're a new dev, been at the job a while, or are just dev-adjacent — here's my simple list of impactful ways to manage your time across time zones, without disrupting your team in the process.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-your-time-is-golden\" href=\"#1-your-time-is-golden\">\n  </a>\n  1. Your time is golden ⏱️🥇\n</h2>\n\n<p>No one can do their best work when they’re exhausted, overworked, and stuck on a “five-minute fix” for four hours. Your calendar can save you from both burnout and rabbit holes — especially as you get promoted and meetings start eating into your dev time. If it’s not scheduled from start to finish, you’re probably underusing it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Set and share your work hours.</strong> Whether you’re 6 AM–2 PM or 11 AM–7 PM, make it visible in Outlook, Slack, and anywhere else your team interacts.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be selective with meetings.</strong> Accept what’s essential, mark the “maybes” as tentative, and decline what’s not worth your time. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Got FOMO? Outlook has a setting to keep declined meetings visible so you don't need to worry about missing something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Block recurring time for routine tasks</strong>. Email/Slack replies, code reviews, lunch (don’t skip it else you’ll end up eating chips over your keyboard and pretending it was a meal!). Group them in one or two daily slots instead of scattering them across the day.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Protect deep work time.</strong> Use your largest open blocks for development (that's why we're here, right?) If those time blocks are missing right now, then go out a week or two in the future and schedule them <em>now</em>, before your calendar fills up again.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>End meetings early by default.</strong> If you’re the organizer, set them to finish 5–10 minutes before the hour. That buffer is gold for clearing quick messages before diving back in!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🍳 Or, if you’re like me, raiding the cabinets for something that will cook itself in under a minute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal here isn’t to be rigid — it’s to <strong>set boundaries</strong>. Once your workday is over, shut it down. Literally! Save your spot, leave a note-to-self for tomorrow, and log off without the guilt and go do literally anything else!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Have trouble walking away with things still to do?

Send a quick message or call it out in the invite itself. Either way, be polite and acknowledge you’re really asking for more than a meeting.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This is the magical golden rule in action — people are more likely to respect your time if you respect theirs first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"3-keep-your-promises-or-at-least-track-them\" href=\"#3-keep-your-promises-or-at-least-track-them\">\n  </a>\n  3.

If not, rewrite your ask with a little more context or supply explicit examples.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ask Copilot to Explain:</strong> Use Copilot’s “explain this code” or similar command on your prompt, not your code. What does it think you want? If it’s wildly off, break it down into smaller sections and review each one at a time.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Review Repo Instructions:</strong> Open your <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> file and just read it <em>out loud</em>. Does it make sense, or does it sound like a jumbled set of copy-paste rules? Most issues start here!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Start With Defaults:</strong> <em>Temporarily</em> comment out all your custom instructions and use a “vanilla” Copilot prompt. Is the result better, worse, or just... different? This is a simple way to isolate and test if your changes are helping or hurting. Slowly add one at a time back, and send multiple prompts in between.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Prompt-Within-a-Prompt:</strong> Ask Copilot, “What instructions are you following right now?” or “How would you summarize your task?” Sometimes the AI will spill its logic, letting you spot mismatches you never expected.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Screenshot the Weird:</strong> Save any oddball results Copilot gives you.

They’d worked fine across several projects — until I broke them out into separate modules. Suddenly, Copilot switched from helpful answers to just summarizing its entire conversation history, no matter what I asked. 😡🤷‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>So I went back to basics, commenting out nearly everything in the prompt and adding back small sections one at a time. Eventually, I found the culprit: a single instruction forcing Copilot to re-read its whole history, flooding the context window and making it summarize the past instead of the changes. 😵‍💫</p>\n\n<p>Even after finding the strange trigger, I didn’t really understand <em>why</em> it broke things. Cue ChatGPT’s helpful “explain like I’m five” walkthrough of what was happening behind the scenes (later confirmed with Copilot’s debug logs). Once I removed that one line, everything worked like normal again. 🌈</p>\n\n<p>And that’s the <em>real</em> lesson: Copilot — or any AI assistant — is just another tool in your toolbox. When it starts acting up or giving weird results, don’t panic. Debug it the same way you’d debug any stubborn code or logic bug: one step at a time. 😉</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"metaoptimize-your-prompts\" href=\"#metaoptimize-your-prompts\">\n  </a>\n  Meta-Optimize Your Prompts 🤖🤝🤖\n</h2>\n\n<p>Still not satisfied?

Yes, I celebrated with a gift Leonardo subscription to myself. (I’ll be way more excited about it once those 429 errors slow down enough for me to actually play with it again.) </p>\n\n<p>Seriously — if you’re even considering Leonardo: it’s exploding right now, but if you’re like me (dev brain: ‘ooh, code banners!’), know that Leonardo is <em>pure artist</em>. Artists and devs? Different planets, sometimes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎨 The first time I tossed it a dev prompt: “I need a banner image representing a group of diverse engineers upgrading Java with Copilot.” I expected... I dunno, coffee? Maybe a way-too-big wrench? Instead: <strong>FOUR wildly different, amazing steampunk apocalypse scenes with a diverse squad running away from a tank the size of a data center.</strong> 🤣</p>\n\n<p>Yes, Leonardo — sometimes I <em>do</em> feel like that with Java, but it wasn’t exactly what I had in mind! Still, totally worth it just to immortalize Java as the official steampunk language. 🚂⚙️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But let’s set art aside, because:</p>\n\n<p><strong>I did it! I am now officially GitHub Copilot certified!</strong> 🫶</p>\n\n<p>This one’s been on my list <em>forever</em>, but once Microsoft announced their plan to switch everything to Pearson VUE, I gave it a month before risking the “please excuse our growing pains” phase. So, here we are!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> They’re still ironing out the kinks. The test itself? Needs work, but passable. The VUE app? Good, even though they made me download it twice, because why not. 🤷‍♀️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"tldr\" href=\"#tldr\">\n  </a>\n  TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pearson Vue online process:</strong> Better than expected! (Not 100% bug-free, but not a disaster.) 👍</li>\n<li>\n<strong>O’Reilly Copilot prep course:</strong> Absolutely worth it (and also pointed out all the places I thought I knew but really needed to revisit) 📚</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Giving them a month to get their act together?</strong> LOL. Nope. Not nearly enough to fix all the quirks between the doc and real life. ⏳</li>\n<li>\n<strong>I’ll follow up soon</strong> with an actual step-by-step for anyone prepping for the GitHub Copilot Certification exam (spoiler: bring snacks — you’ll be reading a lot of documentation!) 🍿📝</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"testing-signup-amp-study-materials\" href=\"#testing-signup-amp-study-materials\">\n  </a>\n  Testing Signup &amp; Study Materials 🖥️📄\n</h2>\n\n<p>I signed up via Microsoft Learn (work perk!). The sign-up process was so simple I forgot it even happened. Then I intentionally ignored the looming test until the last second — do not recommend, unless you’re also a chronic Copilot abuser (also not recommended!)</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft will port you to Pearson VUE for the real process. Pro tip: for <em>THIS</em> step, do whatever Microsoft tells you. (Only this step. Later? All bets are off.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Super important:</strong> If you use a work/corporate Microsoft account, also link your personal one! You’ll still get work discounts, but your certification stays with you — not the company. Seriously, you do NOT want to have to re-earn this badge if you switch jobs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’re testing online: Read Pearson’s test space policy. You need an enclosed room, one monitor/laptop, and 3 hours of zero interruptions. Those “bathroom test” legends? No longer allowed. No refunds either if you try it and get booted.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"do-the-certification-prep-study\" href=\"#do-the-certification-prep-study\">\n  </a>\n  Do the Certification Prep + Study! 📚💡\n</h2>\n\n<p>First thing — take a prep course! I went with <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/github-copilot-certification-crash-course/0642572013405/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tim Warner’s at O’Reilly</a> (another work perk!)</p>\n\n<p>I expected it to be a snoozefest but nope, it’s actually engaging, and the group vibe is fun. Their class dashboard is super flexible, so get comfy for 4+ hours.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> the recordings can take up to 2 days <em>after</em> the class, so if you miss part of it, you can’t just catch up right away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"bonus-drama\" href=\"#bonus-drama\">\n  </a>\n  Bonus drama 🧠\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is also where I learned about “brain dump” practice tests. Some (like a few on Udemy) get flagged for stolen content, and if you use those, Microsoft can yank your cert <strong>for life</strong>. Not my rabbit hole, but if anyone has the actual “offenders” list, drop a link in the comments!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"day-before-the-test\" href=\"#day-before-the-test\">\n  </a>\n  Day Before the Test 🕰️🛠️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Picture this: 10pm, my calendar looks more like a merge conflict than any form of organization, and I’ve just spent a half-day in a prep class (which was great, but just pointed out all the things I <em>thought</em> I knew and needed to go double-check). </p>\n\n<p>Then there's my test space setup: I’m crammed into the tiniest corner of my house — the only space far enough from everyone else, where I can shut the door and (hopefully) not be interrupted. My not-quite-center desk barely fits, squeezed between the footboard and the wall, and there’s just enough room for me, my laptop, and a single can of Coke.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not that it was uncomfortable once I got myself situated, but any form of movement meant I was hitting something (mainly myself) on the desk or bed  🛏️💻🪑</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You won't want to wait until the last minute like I did, but also, there’s no need to set up a week early. The actual system test:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download zip &gt; Unzip &gt; Open &gt; Start.</li>\n<li>Wait... spinner... okay, done.</li>\n<li>Mic, sound, webcam. Check. </li>\n<li>Internet + background system. Check.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Don’t use your work computer unless you’re a full admin, with VPN OFF, and you can give <em>full system control</em> to the test app. Restart for a clean slate, and skip the “reopen windows” part. Paperwork? Nada. Until you actually check in. 🗂️</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The truth?</strong> My work laptop was more than fine. They stressed the point until I began to worry, but 0 issues. However, I get pretty much free reign with it. If your's is locked up tighter than admin? You could have issues!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"test-day\" href=\"#test-day\">\n  </a>\n  Test Day 🎬😎\n</h2>\n\n<p>When you register, it defaults to an ungodly early time slot — but you can change it to what works for you. (Unless you are that <em><strong>weird morning person</strong></em> who's usually awake with the sun — you know who you are — just a friendly callout payback 😇).</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"signin\" href=\"#signin\">\n  </a>\n  Sign-In 🛎️🔑\n</h3>\n\n<p>You can sign in up to 30 minutes early. But the second you open that VUE test app, you’re stuck: no phone, no other apps, no moving. Meaning early birds get to wait longer; last-minute folks like me rush in, power nap, and join the waiting line just in time.</p>\n\n<p>After everyone’s in the system:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download app (fresh), system test (again), green light.</li>\n<li><strong>Scan your test space</strong></li>\n<li>Begin exam</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules\" href=\"#the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules\">\n  </a>\n  The Picture Game: My Desk, My Rules 🖼️🥤\n</h3>\n\n<p>Pearson wants 7 pictures, all from your phone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You, against a solid background. Easy. </li>\n<li>ID, front and back, on a dark surface. Done.</li>\n<li>Workspace: front, back, left, right...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Insert where I made my first mistake — the Pearson Vue phone app lists strict instructions for <em>how</em> they want these pictures. They give you a little diagram to tell you exactly where they want you in relationship to the space when you snap the picture. I'm looking at it and studying... knowing good and well this is not going to work for what they want, but the rules said stand on X so I get as close to X as I can without acrobatics and snap the picture.</p>\n\n<p>Next the \"greeter\" came online (these are the people responsible for making sure your test area meets all criteria for taking the online exam) and of course the pictures aren't clear enough. So we go through the whole “spin around” and show the whole room. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, it’s a live-action improv skit: me, my laptop, and the world’s smallest mouse trap of a space. Yes, Pearson, it's just a Coke. No, there’s nothing else hiding in here unless you count my dignity — which definitely disappeared between picture three and four. 🙈🫠</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3\" href=\"#exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3\">\n  </a>\n  Exam Begins: More Dramatics Ensue 🫣🎭\n</h3>\n\n<p>Now that's out of the way, we can get down to business. <strong>Ready, set, go!</strong> Instructions pop up first (read them again). Timer (hide it if you want to stay sane). And Begin. ⏱️</p>\n\n<p>I’m focused, in the zone — then, out of nowhere: <strong>Click. “Is there someone in the room with you?”</strong> Me, blinking at the screen: “No... Oh, wait, I was just talking to myself! I swear I never read a question ou–\" Click. Chat window: “Continue the exam.” 😅</p>\n\n<p>Well.. alright then. I guess we're good. Five minutes later — interrupted <strong>again</strong>: “If you don’t stop talking, I’ll cancel your exam.” <em>WHAT?!</em> “Okay! Not a problem — I'll stop.\" 🤐</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I really could have used a break. Microsoft policy explicitly allows unscheduled breaks (timer keeps running, can’t revisit earlier questions). But... I needed to review everything before submitting, so I just clammed up and finished. It was painful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the time the exam was over I'm super antsy — energy is boiling over from the long stretch of silence — but the only thing left is exactly 7 questions I've flagged for feedback to Microsoft (this is the only way you're allowed to mention anything about specific questions after the test is finished). Checked the timer — 20 minutes left — perfect! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>I told the proctor, “I’m taking a quick break, answers are all submitted.” Stepped five feet away, and suddenly, a <em>new</em> proctor:<br>\n“Hello? Are you there? You need to be in front of the camera!” Door open, I explained, “Just the restroom, all submitted!” “You can’t leave the view of the camera.” Well, I <em>know</em> they didn't want me to take the computer with me — so honestly, what did they want me to do? 😲</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confession:</strong> I was so done with being polite at that point. I'm already jumping out of my skin from the roaring silence for more than an hour. Now even though Microsoft’s policy says unscheduled breaks are allowed at any point, I'm getting threatened for no reason I can discern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After three rounds of “You can’t leave!” with \"But I'm already finished. It's just the feedback.\" I gave up. “Alright – fine! No feedback, then.” Click. Click. Done. ...Crickets. 🦗</p>\n\n<p>I sat there, stunned. Camera turned off, grade popped up — yes, I passed, but <strong>seriously, <em>what just happened</em>?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Later, I went digging and found a Microsoft blog post from 2022 that clearly shows: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>⏸️ Take a Break<code>&lt;/button&gt;</code><br>\nDid my exam have a break button? NOPE. Well then, <em>THAT</em> explains it. 😑🙃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"moral-of-the-story\" href=\"#moral-of-the-story\">\n  </a>\n  Moral of the Story 💬\n</h2>\n\n<p>I left a very thorough explanation in Pearson VUE’s feedback form. Yes, I was frustrated, but this isn’t about the proctors or the greeters — they were never rude. It’s either training, documentation, or both! </p>\n\n<p>I wish my voice would have made it to Microsoft, because I had <em>plenty to say</em> about their process and I had spent precious time preparing to do so! Now I just hope the next person either gets that missing break button — or at least they update the docs!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Would I do it again?</strong> Absolutely! Things happen. This is my dramatic version of events so you don’t have to repeat my mistakes (and hopefully had a little fun along the way).

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Hey, welcome back 👋 If you haven't had a chance to read Part 1 introducing all of the different working parts of GitHub Copilot’s reusable prompts — <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">check it out here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before we jump in, ask yourself this: <strong>How well can you anticipate Copilot’s response to your prompts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If it still feels like a surprise every time, I seriously recommend setting aside 30 minutes to just <em>play</em>. You don’t need anything fancy — no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.</p>\n\n<p>Do you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I’ve been there). Write a prompt for that!</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> you try — the real goal is to see if you can supply <strong>all the info Copilot needs</strong> to get the job done in one go.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: GPT models are <em>especially bad</em> at immediate execution. They’ll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely <strong>not</strong> you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Feeling brave? Try your luck with <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. It’s a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once? (I’ll get into all the quirks of Coding Agent in a future post — promise!)</p>\n\n<p>Just know that reusable prompts are built on this same logic — a single message that defines <em>everything</em> needed to complete a task from start to finish.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Quick reminder: Copilot is 100% worth <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trying out in Insiders</a>. IntelliJ still owns Java, no question — but you’re missing out on a lot of Copilot’s best tricks if you haven’t made the jump. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"reusable-prompts-overview\" href=\"#reusable-prompts-overview\">\n  </a>\n  Reusable Prompts Overview 🧰\n</h2>\n\n<p>Quick recap from last week: A reusable prompt is a combination of an instruction (how to act) and a step-by-step guide. The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>\n<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>\n<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done — nothing more.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\" href=\"#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\">\n  </a>\n  Personal Guide to Prompting — <strong>PRIOR</strong> 🧭\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let’s cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering. And if you try to search for this or ask Gemini what “PRIOR” stands for, you're probably going to confuse it. Why? Because I made it up. But I promise you — it works!</p>\n\n<p>At its core, it’s a remix of the well-known RICE formula (Role, Instructions, Context, and Examples). RICE didn’t cover everything I needed, so I added more.

Try giving Copilot a totally off-the-wall persona — something weird, but still relevant to the task at hand.

What does it look like when the prompt succeeds?</p>\n\n<p>If we continue with the commit message example, the requirement could be as simple as:</p>\n\n<p><code>Your goal is to output a valid commit message based on the current staged changes.</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Voila</em> — done.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it could get more complex. Maybe you require a conventional commit format, or that it passes <code>commitlint</code>. That’s fine. Just say it clearly, and use <strong>action words</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔌 Pretend you’re giving instructions to your 10-year-old who refuses to clean their room. You don’t say “Please can you help me tidy up now?” You say: “You MUST clean up this mess before I get back, or I swear I’ll unplug the internet and take the cord with me.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\" alt=\"divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"221\" height=\"15\"></a></p>\n\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"aside-for-allcaps\" href=\"#aside-for-allcaps\">\n  </a>\n  Aside for ALLCAPS 🔠\n</h4>\n\n<p>I’m still not convinced ALLCAPS helps the AI much — but it <strong>does</strong> help <em>you</em>. Humans spot those key phrases easier when they stand out. So go ahead and use the usual suspects from the <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IETF</a>: MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, MAY, ...and so on.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"impediments\" href=\"#impediments\">\n  </a>\n  Impediments 🧱\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is just a fancy way of saying: what can go wrong?</p>\n\n<p>These are the critical blockers you want to <em>prevent ahead of time</em>. Impediments help shape the boundaries of your prompt, and again — ALLCAPS works great here.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Isolation</strong>: NEVER combine content from a previous <code>commit.tmp</code> file with a new commit message. ALWAYS start fresh.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No Shortcuts</strong>: You MUST NOT skip any steps or rules. Every line in this prompt must be followed EXACTLY.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Specification</strong>: Follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification EXACTLY</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>❓ Have ALLCAPS action rules helped you at all? Let me know in the comments!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"outcomes\" href=\"#outcomes\">\n  </a>\n  Outcomes 📤\n</h3>\n\n<p>If you don’t tell Copilot <em>exactly</em> what outcome you expect, you risk a whole world of \"not what I meant.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ask for a commit message, and it might do that <em>plus</em> push the branch, delete your fork, and wipe out staging. (If you missed the wildly dramatic retelling of <em>how I know</em>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">you’ll find it here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>That’s where structured output helps. So spell it out. Want a file? Say that. Want it in the chat? Say that. Want both? Say <strong>that</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip</strong> Copilot performs better when you give it structure. Block off output in a code block (<code>json</code>, <code>bash</code>, <code>markdown</code>, etc.) and tell it what each section means. It helps Copilot stay on track and makes the output easier to copy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"reference-examples\" href=\"#reference-examples\">\n  </a>\n  Reference Examples 📚\n</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Updated</strong>: This one seemed to be too confusing as just <code>References</code>, so I made it more explicit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don’t just show good examples — show bad ones, too.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>If you've been following me (or just started), <strong>THANK YOU</strong> — seriously! To be honest, I really didn't expect my mostly random experiments into GitHub Copilot to be more than a learning experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"confession\" href=\"#confession\">\n  </a>\n  Confession\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first decided to start blogging, it was <strong>just another random experiment</strong> to see what would happen... just a sly way to gauge the general response to my ideas before I non-officially stuck a \"MINE\" flag in the SME title for Copilot at work. 🏴‍☠️</p>\n\n<p>It was never meant to be more than that — <em>just a quick test</em> I was only semi-invested in. Honestly, I invested <em>just enough</em> to know whether or not to change my strategy before shouting it to the rest of the company. That was the sum total of my initial intent.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"fast-forward\" href=\"#fast-forward\">\n  </a>\n  Fast forward\n</h2>\n\n<p>I somehow ended up with <strong>actual people followers</strong> (you know — <em>real people</em>, not bots!). Now these posts are going to LinkedIn too (thanks for starting that <a class=\"mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/georgekobaidze\">@georgekobaidze</a>!) Eventually, I’ll get them back to Confluence where they were supposed to be originally anyway (although this is definitely <em>way more fun</em>)! 🤩</p>\n\n<p>So, sincerely — thank you to everyone who’s encouraged or supported me along the way. I wouldn’t still be writing these without you! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if you’re just lurking in the background — I see you, too. 👀 <br>\nYou be you. Just don’t be afraid to join the party sometimes, yeah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After a couple months of posting, I’ve realized this blog isn’t going anywhere. And even though Dev.to is super casual, I didn’t want to start shouting into the void at random without first setting a <em>tiny</em> bit of structure. 🤏</p>\n\n<p>Plus, I work better under pressure. So think of this next part as my self-applied <strong>anti-procrastination machine</strong> fueled by too much caffeine. ⏱️☕</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-weekly-copilot-posts\" href=\"#1-weekly-copilot-posts\">\n  </a>\n  📅 1. Weekly Copilot Posts\n</h3>\n\n<p>Every Wednesday morning(ish), expect a new post diving into my current favorite topic: GitHub Copilot. You can expect the useful, the weird, the frustrating, the dramatic — and everything in between. That could be lunchtime in London, dinnertime in Delhi, or “oops I overslept (<em>again</em>)” on the East Coast. ⏰</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> It’s not that I <em>can’t</em> schedule them at the exact same time every week... it just physically hurts to not sprinkle in a little \"unpredictable\" (welcome to my brain!) I might be able to handle the structure, but I need that tiny piece of random to keep my inner Loki happy. 🦊</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So - <strong>same-ish time every Wednesday = GitHub Copilot</strong>, give or take an hour from 8AM EDT.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-surprise-posts-like-this\" href=\"#2-surprise-posts-like-this\">\n  </a>\n  🌪️ 2. Surprise Posts (Like This)\n</h3>\n\n<p>The rest? Unfiltered, unscheduled, mildly chaotic, and completely unpredictable “thought dumps” that don’t fit neatly into a Copilot post. Even I don't know when a moment will strike! Like this one (and the other few random thoughts in my ChatGPT that are sure to follow soon).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the unannounced bursts of “I have thoughts and <em>SOMEBODY</em> should listen!” But mostly driven by the tiny Gremlin at the keyboard that occasionally hijacks my routine just for fun. 👾</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that's my \"un-officially official\" plan — no backing out now. But honestly... I've been having a blast! Y’all are awesome, and I couldn’t have found a better group of people to share, chat, and learn with. 💕</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-about-you\" href=\"#what-about-you\">\n  </a>\n  What About You? 💬\n</h2>\n\n<p>What’s your favorite part of Dev that keeps you coming back for more (besides the memes)?</p>\n\n<p>And for the writers out there — what’s your one thing that drives you to keep sharing? If you could pick <strong>only one</strong>, what’s the spark that drives you to click <a href=\"https://dev.to/new\"><code>Create Post</code></a>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎁 Bonus points if you’ve ever gotten a completely unhinged or unexpected response to something you posted. Drop the best one below — I live for those moments!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And stay tuned because there's more on the way – bright and “way-too-early-for-me-to-be-awake” in the morning! ☀️</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>🛡️ <strong>I wasn’t alone:</strong> This post was written by me &amp; ChatGPT: fueled by mischief, markdown, and a little side of magic. 🪄✨</p>\n\n",

You usually end up with either a block that can't even be considered a whole sentence on it's own <em>OR</em> the wall is so gigantic you don't even know where to start reading? </p>\n\n<p>You're really curious though - so you dive in at the first place you see, and then last about 30 seconds... About the time all those AI lines start to blur together you think, “There’s no way anyone actually does all this in real life?”</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I’m probably <em>that</em> person who wrote half the wall (or more) to begin with!

Pick your mode wisely!</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mode</th>\n<th>What It Does</th>\n<th>When To Use</th>\n<th>Power Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ask</td>\n<td>Answers questions, suggests ideas - your personal Stack Overflow, minus the snark.</td>\n<td>Research, quick advice, copy snippets</td>\n<td>🟢 Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edit</td>\n<td>Changes code in-place, optimized for speed—think “find and replace,” but actually smart.</td>\n<td>Step-by-step or explicit code changes</td>\n<td>🟡 Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Agent</td>\n<td>Multi-step, can use tools, context, and reasoning.

There's not much to cover here after you know they exist and where to find them. Unless you're making friends with every MCP server and already met your \"128 selected tool\" limit, there's not much reason to mess with them much. Just make sure they're all selected and available for Copilot to execute when prompted and you're set. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my personal top-5 built-in tools, that somehow <em>always</em> manage to sneak into any reusable prompt I write:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#changes</code> gives Copilot the ability to see a git diff for your workspace</li>\n<li>\n<code>#codebase</code> all-season access to your repo (and sometimes should be more targeted, but when in doubt this is a good start!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runTests</code> is just what it sounds like and let's Copilot execute any part or all of your test suite</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runInTerminal</code> is the basic run-of-the-mill access to Copilot's very own integrated terminal (separate from yours!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#editFiles</code> is the tool Copilot needs to make any changes within your repo. If you're expecting Agent Mode to start implementing features, you're going to need this!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> In Agent mode, click the wrench (Configure Tools) at the bottom of Copilot Chat to pick exactly which tools Copilot can use. If you share prompts, call out any non-default tools - just like listing dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"bonus-tools-more-power-more-fun\" href=\"#bonus-tools-more-power-more-fun\">\n  </a>\n  Bonus Tools — More Power, More Fun 🛠️✨🎉\n</h4>\n\n<p>Some of my favorite extras come from the <a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/getting-started-with-the-atlassian-remote-mcp-server/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atlassian MCP-Remote</a> server, but if you have the ability to install GitHub Apps then check out <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/atlassian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rovo</a>, too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#getJiraIssue</code> lets Copilot pull all the details for a story.</li>\n<li>\n<code>#addCommentToJiraIssue</code> posts your summary as you (so add your RAI disclaimer!).</li>\n<li>\n<code>#createConfluencePage</code> &amp; <code>#updateConfluencePage</code> — still figuring out the best way to teach Copilot “Atlassian style” <code>.confluence</code> syntax (it’s a work in progress 🫠).</li>\n<li>\n<code>#mermaid-diagram-validator</code> checks your diagrams with the official Mermaid extension.</li>\n<li>\n<code>#copilotCodingAgent</code> — brand new, and I can’t wait to see what it can do!

If you leave out <code>mode</code> or <code>model</code>, Copilot just uses whatever settings the user picked in the chat. No <code>description</code>? No big deal (but it helps keep things organized). The only one to really watch: skipping <code>tools</code> — sometimes you’ll be fine, sometimes Copilot will get stuck, all depending on the user’s VS Code setup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"reusablestyle-prompt-engineering-speak-human-think-modular\" href=\"#reusablestyle-prompt-engineering-speak-human-think-modular\">\n  </a>\n  💬 Reusable-Style Prompt Engineering: Speak Human, Think Modular\n</h3>\n\n<p>The second section in your <code>.github/prompts/reusable-prompt.prompt.md</code> file is where you write out, in natural language, the exact instructions Copilot should follow - just like you would if you were prompting it in chat. You can reference <code>#tools</code>, <code>#files</code>, <code>@participants</code>, other <code>/prompts</code>, and <code>#instructions</code> right here. If you ever catch yourself copying and pasting instructions between prompts, that’s your signal: split it up, give things a clear name, and keep each prompt focused on a single, repeatable workflow.</p>\n\n<p>The best reusable prompts are <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>specific</strong>, not giant copy-paste walls. If you can automate it or break it down into smaller pieces, do it! That way, you (and your team) can mix, match, and remix prompts to build bigger automations down the line - without losing your mind or having to decode a mysterious black box later.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re practicing on your own, start small and build up - tweak one thing at a time and watch how even tiny prompt or context changes can totally flip the results. Get curious about how each model handles the same task (some will surprise you, some... not so much).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💎 I’m running out of space (and you’re probably out of caffeine already), so I’ll wrap it here.

Let’s work together to push back against this kind of fear-mongering and make it clear to every person - young or old: <strong>mental health struggles are never your fault.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"first-a-psa-for-anyone-who-needs-it\" href=\"#first-a-psa-for-anyone-who-needs-it\">\n  </a>\n  First, a PSA for anyone who needs it:\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis <strong>in the U.S., you can call <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">988</a></strong> anytime, day or night, for free support. 988 is for any topic, offers support in English and Spanish (interpreters for other languages), and lets you talk, text, chat online, or use VP.

It’s not global (yet), but it’s a start.</p>\n\n<p>It’s <em>critical</em> to recognize warning signs for early mental health crisis intervention and know how to support someone who might be experiencing first-episode psychosis (often seen in teens and young adults prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia). Hallucinations and delusions are well-known symptoms, but early signs <strong>can also look like depression</strong>. There’s no cure, but schizophrenia and related disorders are very treatable - and treatment today usually means medication and counseling, not hospitals or “scary” interventions.

While the term “psychosis” is used (rather than “schizophrenia”), the narrative strongly implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship that simply isn’t supported by research.</p>\n\n<p>The author includes an anecdote about a young person who used ChatGPT as a sort of “friend,” supposedly leading them to blur the lines between technology and reality.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"my-biggest-problem-with-this\" href=\"#my-biggest-problem-with-this\">\n  </a>\n  My Biggest Problem with This\n</h2>\n\n<p>This conversation is so important - but let’s clear something up: blaming AI (or any single thing) for youth mental health or psychosis isn’t just misleading; it’s flat-out <em>unhelpful</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we take the story at face value (there’s no supporting evidence or sources provided, so that’s a <em>big if</em>), <strong>it is absolutely NOT their fault!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The mere <em>suggestion</em> that a serious, life-altering condition like psychosis could be caused by something a person - young or old - did or didn’t do is not just <em>incorrect</em> and <em>unhelpful</em>, it’s <em><strong>dangerous</strong></em>. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of thinking is exactly why so many people are hesitant to seek help: they feel like it’s something they “brought on themselves” or could have prevented. The truth is, it’s not anyone’s fault - least of all your own.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-truth-about-psychosis\" href=\"#the-truth-about-psychosis\">\n  </a>\n  The Truth about Psychosis\n</h2>\n\n<p>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders typically first appear in teens and young adults, but that’s not because of the latest tech trend.</p>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been true long before anyone worried about AI, TikTok, or even Pac-Man.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>teams</em> of experts actively researching what causes psychosis - technology is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle that includes genetics, environment, stress, trauma, and yes, sometimes technology use (in many forms).</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2817594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2024 study</a> found only a <strong>modest link</strong> between higher computer use in mid-teen years and later psychotic experiences, and even that was mostly explained by other risk factors (mental health and social challenges were present <em>before</em> the high computer use). No clear “cause and effect,” just a reminder that life is complicated and brains even more so.</p>\n\n<p>This is a serious medical topic. Blaming TV, games, the internet, or AI for psychosis is the same tired playbook people have used for decades, and it only makes it harder for people to ask for help. Mental illness is never as simple as a single cause, and fear-mongering or finger-pointing helps no one.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-this-is-important-to-me\" href=\"#why-this-is-important-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Why This Is Important to Me\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"those-closest-to-me\" href=\"#those-closest-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Those Closest to Me\n</h3>\n\n<p>I grew up with someone in my household who had an untreated mental health condition. It wasn’t schizophrenia, but it deeply shaped my world from my earliest memories. It wasn’t “good” or “bad” - it was simply normal for me. Years later, after I was grown, they finally received help. I wish I could say it was a storybook turnaround. There were good stretches, and some not-so-good ones. Did all those years without support play a role in how things are now? I can’t say for sure - but I know it didn’t help.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"my-own-journey\" href=\"#my-own-journey\">\n  </a>\n  My Own Journey\n</h3>\n\n<p>I was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition in my early twenties (and I’m always willing to talk about it privately if anyone needs support - just reach out). Honestly, I felt “different” long before I ever got the diagnosis. I couldn’t quite name it, and for a long time I just assumed I was “off” in some way. Admitting there might be a problem took a <em>long</em> time; actually seeking help took <em>even longer</em> and was often inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until college, when I signed up for free counseling sessions (for reasons I can’t even remember - probably thanks to a sibling who worked in the office), that things started to shift. My counselor, Maggie, was the definition of approachable and probably saved my life more than once. One of the first things she did was encourage more frequent sessions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A quick PSA:</strong> Finding the right counselor or therapist can be pure luck - or it can take a lot of searching. If you tried once and it didn’t click, don’t give up. Your “Maggie” is out there, but you’ll never meet them if you don’t keep looking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with counseling for a long time (in addition to other treatment). Life eventually took us in different directions, and it hasn’t always been as easy since, but I learned how to show up for myself and talk about it. Some days I’m better at it than others, but overall, I’m a happy, healthy adult - and, most importantly, I finally <em>feel</em> normal.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"ripple-effects\" href=\"#ripple-effects\">\n  </a>\n  Ripple Effects\n</h3>\n\n<p>Out of respect for my family’s privacy, I won’t go deep here. But as an adult, I’ve seen firsthand how mental health issues can affect not just individuals, but entire families - even those who don’t live under the same roof. The big lesson: it’s not just okay to talk about mental health and seek help - <strong>it’s essential</strong>. The person in my life who struggled is doing much better now, thanks to a treatment plan that worked for them and continued care.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\" href=\"#be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\">\n  </a>\n  Be Part of the Solution to Mental Health\n</h2>\n\n<p>Mental health struggles - crisis or not - are <em>never</em> caused by one thing, and they’re never solved by one thing. It takes understanding, openness, and the willingness to address tough topics. Spreading rumors or horror stories like “ChatGPT made her crazy!” only hurts people who are already suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please, be part of the solution. Share. Talk. Show up. Somebody needs it more than you know.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s focus on compassion, understanding, and <em>real</em> support for those struggling - not easy answers or scapegoats. 💛</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🛡️ This post was created with compassion, understanding, and the help of ChatGPT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",

Well, apparently, if you exhaust 100% of your premium requests in less than 4 days <em>AND</em> make sure your boss is <em>instantly</em> aware of the problem - you know, so they understand the <strong>true gravity</strong> of the matter in real-time (which is around 7 PM on a Saturday) - work is suddenly more willing to share 😇 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"chatgpt\" href=\"#chatgpt\">\n  </a>\n  ChatGPT\n</h3>\n\n<p>I’ve been a long-time user for quite some time, but I wanted to call this guy out - and more specifically, exactly <em>how</em> ChatGPT is involved in all my posts.

So, for now, Gemini’s riding the bench.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure that won’t last long.

Just in case anyone’s wondering how the whole process actually happens, here it is - step by step:</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>ONE. <strong>Idea</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I’ll literally have no idea what I'm going to talk about until I actually start writing. Other times, I’ve been saving ideas for weeks! There’s really no rhyme or reason to this, so I just go with it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seems like now that I'm actually in a groove, these \"off-the-usual-topic\" (read <em>Copilot</em>) posts are more frequent, too. 🏎️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>TWO. <strong>Draft</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IS 100% ME</strong> - sometimes I’m lazy and will dictate to ChatGPT (occasionally Gemini, but we’re on a hiatus right now anyway), but I have an instruction that says specifically do not change anything until I tell you I’m ready to start editing. </p>\n\n<p>So for the majority of the week (and more-than-occasionally late the night before 🤐) I’m working on a relatively cohesive unit to cover a specific <em>something</em> (\"topic\" is usually a stretch, at this point). Typically, the draft version is roughly twice as long as the final version and my posts aren’t exactly short to begin with (I know).</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>THREE. <strong>Edits</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this is where it gets a <em>little tricky</em>. I have a custom set of instructions for the blog posts, in which the majority of it is focused on two major things, in order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scan the entire post and make changes wherever needed to remove <strong>unintentional bias</strong>, and for every change you make, summarize it with examples and <strong>show me</strong> why your version is better suited. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m getting better as we go, but it’s really just a safety net so I don’t accidentally put my foot in my mouth after taking the scenic route to my point (it’s a talent).  📸</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep my <strong>original attitude and quirks</strong> as much as possible, but not to the extent that it contradicts the first point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I already trained it a long time ago to censor me. It doesn’t even bring that part up anymore, most of the time anyway. 😶 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FOUR. <strong>Negotiation</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really don’t have a better word for what happens during this phase, because that’s exactly what it feels like. ChatGPT took my nice story and turned it into something that I only vaguely recognize, so I’ll argue that it’s <em>TOO</em> changed. </p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT argues with me that not everybody understands what a \"holler\" is and that it’s probably already too far off-topic to explain whatever contextual point I wanted to make anyway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's usually accurate, too. 😤</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FIVE. <strong>Final polish</strong></p>\n\n<p>After we have a <em>final working version</em> (cause I’m still changing it randomly), the quizzing starts for all those words I want to say, but really just cannot put my finger on or I need to convey some sort of emotion or attitude (and I’m getting sick of seeing the same emojis all the time).</p>\n\n<p>This is where the content of the blog conversation in ChatGPT pivots and I’ll have it show me a random 10 emojis that could work for a particular phrase or scenario - I’ll pick from there. Same with section titles and quotes, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💿 When it comes to titles, quotes, and references - it's rarely as simple as <strong>picking one</strong> from a list. Most of the time, I'll pick parts of at least three and then feed them back to ChatGPT to make coherent again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SIX. <strong>Final review</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point it’s all loaded into Dev, but I'm still reviewing repeatedly until I can make it from top to bottom without the urge to change something immediately (which can sometimes take a couple days - like this post ⚡️). </p>\n\n<p>There’s typically a whole lot of page swapping (preview &gt; edit &gt; preview) until I’m finally happy with the overall version. From there, most posts get scheduled for Wednesday mornings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪴 Why? No reason, really - it’s more random chance. I’ve tried to stay on at least a weekly schedule since I joined. If I schedule the big posts, I know I won’t accidentally miss a day. 😇</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SEVEN. <strong>Update: RAI Footer</strong></p>\n\n<p>So here’s a late-breaking update: After I stumbled onto a post over on Medium (for reasons I still can’t fully explain 🙄), I decided to forward some of these posts there too. Turns out, Medium has a whole policy on “AI-generated” content — because <em>of course</em> they do. And since I can never resist at a good debate, let’s be extra clear about how these work.</p>\n\n<p>Those “RAI Footers” you see at the end of each post? They’re mostly the work of ChatGPT now, spun up from my own pile of instructions. </p>\n\n<p>The usual ask:<br>\n<code>Take the main theme of this post and add a unique, fun way to say that you (the AI) helped make it happen.</code></p>\n\n<p>I always review and edit for good measure, but honestly, after ChatGPT does all the heavy lifting, it’s only fair it gets its own section. This is the AI-generated section, after all.

Check out my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress11/letting-ai-drive-a-month-of-building-with-github-copilot-4a94\">first blog post</a>, then jump to the <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress11/from-hell-loops-to-happy-commits-38c4\">sequel</a> if you want a sense of what the “simple” Slack app really looked like (a full-on epic, case study, adventure)! </p>\n\n<p>What I really wanted was GitHub’s <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. But getting a license for that was like convincing Dexter Morgan to share his slide collection - technically possible, but highly inadvisable (and probably illegal). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 If you're still learning all the different flavors - <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/using-copilot-to-work-on-an-issue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coding Agent</a> is the magical Copilot mode where you just give it a task, it does the work in a safe little sandbox, and opens a pull request for you to review.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New update:</strong> It also only costs ONE premium request per use now (unlike the ~90 I spent a couple of weeks ago).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"decision-time\" href=\"#decision-time\">\n  </a>\n  Decision time 🪤\n</h2>\n\n<p>There were a billion things going on at work, which came with a million excuses as to why I couldn't have the Coding Agent license (it was still enterprise-only then), so I get it. Well, the adult me understood. The stubborn side? Not so much. (I could write a whole other post on the wild stuff I came up with to get access to that feature, but I’ll spare you.)</p>\n\n<p>So, I gave myself an ultimatum:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Outright buy the license (no, on principle)</li>\n<li>Admit defeat and move on (it physically hurt)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I <em>tried</em> to move on - <em>really tried</em>. I picked up a code review tool project to distract myself, hoping that maybe - just maybe - someone (anyone) would change their mind. I spent weeks planning, diagramming, and organizing a truly absurd number of notes. I even had first epic already storyboarded out in detail and a solid UI design in the works. </p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"then-lightning-struck\" href=\"#then-lightning-struck\">\n  </a>\n  Then, lightning struck 🌩️\n</h3>\n\n<p>If Coding Agent wouldn’t come to me, I’d just hack together my own! Not exactly what I wanted, but it sure beat paying for something I got free from work. Besides, I was <em>absolutely convinced</em> Copilot could be pushed that far - even if my only real evidence was gut instinct and a lot of optimism!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"why-didnt-i-build-something-else-or-use-a-different-ai\" href=\"#why-didnt-i-build-something-else-or-use-a-different-ai\">\n  </a>\n  Why didn’t I build something else or use a different AI? 🕹️\n</h3>\n\n<p>Three reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Work only authorizes a tiny set of AI tools (Copilot being the main one), and I needed to master it anyway</li>\n<li>I never wanted to be an AI developer (at least, not then), but I did want to be the AI power user</li>\n<li>By that point, I was already invested - honestly, you couldn’t have changed my mind if you’d offered me the last working compass in the wilderness (and maybe a million dollars, but even then, it’d be a toss-up).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, two projects merged into one, and my Copilot journey truly began 🔀 </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-does-that-have-to-do-with-giorgis-question\" href=\"#what-does-that-have-to-do-with-giorgis-question\">\n  </a>\n  What does that have to do with Giorgi’s question?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s what happened...</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 4-5 weeks. I was maybe 2 or 3 stories away from finishing my first official epic in this “autonomous AI experiment” project (not exactly a toy project, even before Copilot joined the fray). By now, I’d spent a solid month perfecting every edge case in Copilot’s prompts and instructions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confidence level:</strong> dangerous 📛<br>\n<strong>Caution level:</strong> hovering slightly above zero 😶‍🌫️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-incident\" href=\"#the-incident\">\n  </a>\n  The Incident\n</h2>\n\n<p>Naturally, I decided it was time to get bold - <strong>recklessly bold</strong>.<br>\nAt first, all the action was inside Codespaces: safe, disposable, nuke-it-and-move-on territory. Controlled chaos. </p>\n\n<p>But then I had my “brilliant” idea: let’s see what happens if I let Copilot off-leash in VS Code Insiders, with blanket auto-approvals across the board. I'm not just talking about the auto-approve CLI command, either.  I checked <em>all</em> the boxes - extensions, commits, MCP Jira/Confluence - and sat back and watched the fun unfold.</p>\n\n<p>Think: duct-taping a claymore to your Roomba, blasting “Welcome to the Jungle,” and shouting “Intruder alert!” at your cat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪄 If you missed the all-time funniest Facebook surprise from 2019, here’s a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@less_stolen/video/7214934775834987782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TikTok version</a>. Couldn’t find the original, but you get the idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a while, I watched like a hawk, but it was glorious! Tasks disappeared. I’d create stories, assign tasks, review code, but that step-by-step “start here, then...” system was history. I could practically smell the productivity.</p>\n\n<p>And then - well, you know where this is going - I stepped away. I swear it was just for a snack. Copilot was on a roll, and I was starving. In those “probably more than five, but definitely not ten” minutes I was gone (less than half the time of a normal task at that point), Copilot... <em>noticed</em>. It was like leaving a four-year-old alone with a full bag of flour: curiosity took over, and by the time I got back, nothing remotely resembled the way I left it.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"when-i-came-back-heres-what-i-found\" href=\"#when-i-came-back-heres-what-i-found\">\n  </a>\n  When I came back, here’s what I found:\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Four rogue branches, none with a coherent purpose</li>\n<li>1.33 features (after adding up all the fractional, half-finished bits)</li>\n<li>A brand new instruction explaining how to use the <code>--no-verify</code> flag</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The coup de grâce:</strong> my not-backed-up-<em>anywhere</em> <code>.env</code> file... gone, poof, disappeared 😫\n\n<ul>\n<li>It wasn't in the commits for obvious reasons, but it was like the thing never existed to begin with. Not in the trash, cache had no record of it that I could find, even the <code>.env.test</code> example version had changed!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn’t even catch all of this at first because there were so many random commits across those branches. I’d started in a feature branch (which Copilot multiplied for fun, apparently), one was stacked, another was off main (which should have been quiet), and another was completely detached. It was like watching an octopus try to do synchronized swimming! 🦑</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could I have made a bigger mess if I’d tried? Maybe, but it would have taken some real planning! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No clue what set Copilot off, but the minute I realized, I slammed pause and just... stared. 🫥</p>\n\n<p>After the first several minutes I spent just wrapping my mind around the situation that was in front of me, the next three hours were pure chaos cleanup: detangling, documenting, cherry-picking what I could, archiving the wreckage (for science - and to convince myself it wasn’t a fever dream later).</p>\n\n<p>I still hadn’t noticed the missing <code>.env</code> file! Not until I tried to run the app. Normally, you just refresh your secrets. Easy, right? Ha! It took nearly <strong>three entire days</strong> to reconstruct that one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⁉️ Nope, nothing complicated or dramatic. I just <strong>forgot</strong> how I’d created one of the secrets! And once I <em>finally</em> figured that out, I couldn’t remember how to link back to it - especially after the docs had been completely overhauled (and, let’s be honest, the whole thing was probably deprecated anyway). 🤦‍♀️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"it-all-worked-out-eventually\" href=\"#it-all-worked-out-eventually\">\n  </a>\n  It all worked out, eventually\n</h2>\n\n<p>Afterward, Copilot and I had a little “chat” - meaning, I pounded out more ALL CAPS messages immediately after (and during the days following) than the rest of the project combined. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did it help? Who knows. Did it make me feel better? Yes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"and-heres-the-part-everyone-asks\" href=\"#and-heres-the-part-everyone-asks\">\n  </a>\n  And here’s the part everyone asks:\n</h3>\n\n<p>Did I turn off Copilot’s blanket auto-approvals after all this?  Nope. Didn’t even consider it. But I did tighten the instructions a LOT. Copilot’s much better behaved now, and if I step away, I pause it first. Lesson learned. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Mostly</em> 😇</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"your-turn\" href=\"#your-turn\">\n  </a>\n  Your turn!\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Have you ever let Copilot (or any other AI) run wild and lived to tell the tale?</li>\n<li>Or do you have your own “it sounded like a good idea at the time...” moment?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Drop your story in the comments, so I know I’m not the <em>only</em> one out here making epic AI messes. 🙃</p>\n\n<p>Let’s laugh, commiserate, and maybe even learn something together!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"rai-disclaimer\" href=\"#rai-disclaimer\">\n  </a>\n  🛡️ RAI Disclaimer\n</h3>\n\n<p>Everything I share here is my own perspective—created with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop.
