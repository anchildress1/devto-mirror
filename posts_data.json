I’m a very opinionated, very stubborn, and <em>happily backend-only</em> software engineer, which means I spend a fair amount of time actively running away from anything that ends in the letters 'UI'. That detail matters, because it makes everything that follows a little ironic.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t do hackathons, which I wrote about in <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/the-hackathon-i-swore-off-and-the-exhaustion-that-mostly-compiled-c4l\">this post</a>. I really don’t do New Year’s resolutions either! I fundamentally disagree with the idea that growth needs a ceremonial date on the calendar. If something is broken, I want to know now. If it needs fixing, I want to fix it now. Harsh feedback today beats polite intentions tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t about resolutions, and it wasn’t even about a portfolio refresh in isolation. If I had seen this challenge on its own, I probably would have kept scrolling. What stopped me was the pairing with the Algolia challenge, because together they finally lined up with something I’d been meaning to build for a while and hadn’t prioritized. I gave myself a weekend not because I expected something spectacular, but because the tools I wanted to learn finally matched something I actually needed to build, and the timing felt intentional rather than forced.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This wasn’t a month-long build. It was one focused weekend, followed by exactly four (and a half) evenings of intentional obsession over the things you <em>won’t</em> see on the page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnqxh5x11fkmhrsr3vcdq.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnqxh5x11fkmhrsr3vcdq.png\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-problem-beneath-the-prompt\" href=\"#the-problem-beneath-the-prompt\">\n  </a>\n  The Problem Beneath the Prompt 🧠\n</h3>\n\n<p>For me, this was an AI challenge first and a portfolio challenge second. I love my job, I’m not looking for recruiters, and I’m not trying to market myself for a career move. This site exists for experimentation and self-amusement, and it only resembles a portfolio because that’s the shape the challenge happens to take.</p>\n\n<p>I approached the work in two deliberate parts. The first was finally learning Antigravity, which I’d downloaded, glanced at, and then avoided actually using. Pairing that with the Google AI Pro subscription gave me enough room to experiment freely, and in practice that meant leaning heavily on Google Gemini Pro 3 with high reasoning enabled. Every attempt to dial it back introduced subtle breakage, so I accepted higher reasoning as the right tool for this job.</p>\n\n<p>The second part was laying early groundwork for the Algolia challenge by introducing a chatbot up front, rather than bolting it on later. Throughout all of this, ChatGPT stayed firmly in a research-and-orchestration role behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I treated this as an AI challenge first—learning Antigravity now and laying intentional groundwork for the upcoming <a href=\"https://dev.to/devteam/join-the-algolia-agent-studio-challenge-3000-in-prizes-4eli?bb=259943\">Algolia challenge</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"portfolio\" href=\"#portfolio\">\n  </a>\n  Portfolio 💼\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"go-look-first\" href=\"#go-look-first\">\n  </a>\n  Go Look First 🚦\n</h3>\n\n<p>No accounts, no setup, no ceremony.

The structure, accessibility decisions, performance work, mobile behavior, and AI-facing metadata all live below the surface. If you’re curious, there are plenty of ways to see it in action: run a Lighthouse report, check the accessibility scores, view the site on a different device, or inspect the sitemap. You can also chat with Ruckus, the built-in assistant that knows far more about me and my work than is probably reasonable for a proof of concept.</p>\n\n<p>The goal wasn’t to hide complexity, but to place it where it belongs—so the site can be crawled intentionally by AI while still feeling coherent and human to anyone reading it.</p>\n\n<p>The chatbot implementation itself is intentionally straightforward. Its strength comes from the information and constraints I gave it, not from hidden tricks or clever illusions. It runs on GPT-5.2 with a small knowledge base and no memory, and it’s designed to be helpful, honest, and conversational rather than impressive on paper.</p>\n\n<p>Everything here is deployed and tested deliberately. The polish you see is intentional, and the things you don’t see are doing just as much work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> The visible site is only a small part of the work. Most of the effort went into structure, constraints, accessibility, and coordinating multiple AI systems under real-world conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"meet-ruckus-production-ai\" href=\"#meet-ruckus-production-ai\">\n  </a>\n  Meet Ruckus: Production AI 🧪\n</h3>\n\n<p>Ruckus is a constrained, production-deployed assistant. It responds using declared system data, not free-form invention. The goal here isn’t to prove that AI was used, but that it was <em>designed</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What powers Ruckus isn’t a grab-bag of “write me some code” prompts.

It sets tone immediately, signals playfulness, and gives my ADHD something to engage with while I’m evaluating Antigravity’s output by clicking, scrolling, and retriggering effects.</p>\n\n<p>That choice came with tradeoffs. I wanted the fun without sacrificing performance or accessibility, which forced constraints I don’t usually deal with as someone who avoids UI work. What makes this project different from most things I’ve built is that I didn’t review a single line of code. Instead, I worked primarily with Google Gemini Pro 3 in higher‑reasoning mode and evaluated outcomes I could see, test, and benchmark.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This site is a curated systems playground. The playful surface is intentional; the real experiment was evaluating AI-built results, not reviewing code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"what-changed-once-i-stopped-touching-it\" href=\"#what-changed-once-i-stopped-touching-it\">\n  </a>\n  What Changed Once I Stopped Touching It 🔄\n</h3>\n\n<p>When I first dove into Antigravity, I was underwhelmed and couldn’t see how my one‑weekend plan was supposed to work. Once I stopped poking and let Antigravity and Gemini Pro 3 actually run, that opinion shifted quickly—they performed far better than I expected.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest part wasn’t starting, it was stopping. I’m a perfectionist, and without boundaries I’ll keep refining indefinitely. The weekend build quietly stretched into the following week until I moved on to the Algolia challenge and forced myself to declare a version finished.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> The hardest part wasn’t learning Antigravity—it was knowing when to say \"complete enough\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"why-this-counts-as-forward-motion\" href=\"#why-this-counts-as-forward-motion\">\n  </a>\n  Why This Counts as Forward Motion 🚧\n</h3>\n\n<p>This project didn’t change who I am as an engineer. It clarified it. I’m systems-focused, outcome-driven, and willing to stop reviewing code once a system can be evaluated by behavior and performance alone. Defining that boundary—and enforcing it—is what makes this forward motion instead of a one-off experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing it hold up once it was deployed, shared, and interacted with by real people made that boundary tangible instead of theoretical. So overall, I'm calling this a success. Still—my work will stay at the systems layer. <em>A deliberate choice.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I now treat systems-level evaluation, not code review, as a first-class decision point when working with Antigravity + Gemini Pro 3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"end-of-the-training-loop\" href=\"#end-of-the-training-loop\">\n  </a>\n  🛡️ End of the Training Loop\n</h2>\n\n<p>This post was written by a human, with AI used intentionally as a collaborator for research, experimentation, and system construction.

I’m a very opinionated, very stubborn, and <em>happily backend-only</em> software engineer, which means I spend a fair amount of time actively running away from anything that ends in the letters 'UI'. That detail matters, because it makes everything that follows a little ironic.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t do hackathons, which I wrote about in <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/the-hackathon-i-swore-off-and-the-exhaustion-that-mostly-compiled-c4l\">this post</a>. I really don’t do New Year’s resolutions either! I fundamentally disagree with the idea that growth needs a ceremonial date on the calendar. If something is broken, I want to know now. If it needs fixing, I want to fix it now. Harsh feedback today beats polite intentions tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t about resolutions, and it wasn’t even about a portfolio refresh in isolation. If I had seen this challenge on its own, I probably would have kept scrolling. What stopped me was the pairing with the Algolia challenge, because together they finally lined up with something I’d been meaning to build for a while and hadn’t prioritized. I gave myself a weekend not because I expected something spectacular, but because the tools I wanted to learn finally matched something I actually needed to build, and the timing felt intentional rather than forced.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> This wasn’t a month-long build. It was one focused weekend, followed by exactly four (and a half) evenings of intentional obsession over the things you <em>won’t</em> see on the page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnqxh5x11fkmhrsr3vcdq.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnqxh5x11fkmhrsr3vcdq.png\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-problem-beneath-the-prompt\" href=\"#the-problem-beneath-the-prompt\">\n  </a>\n  The Problem Beneath the Prompt 🧠\n</h3>\n\n<p>For me, this was an AI challenge first and a portfolio challenge second. I love my job, I’m not looking for recruiters, and I’m not trying to market myself for a career move. This site exists for experimentation and self-amusement, and it only resembles a portfolio because that’s the shape the challenge happens to take.</p>\n\n<p>I approached the work in two deliberate parts. The first was finally learning Antigravity, which I’d downloaded, glanced at, and then avoided actually using. Pairing that with the Google AI Pro subscription gave me enough room to experiment freely, and in practice that meant leaning heavily on Google Gemini Pro 3 with high reasoning enabled. Every attempt to dial it back introduced subtle breakage, so I accepted higher reasoning as the right tool for this job.</p>\n\n<p>The second part was laying early groundwork for the Algolia challenge by introducing a chatbot up front, rather than bolting it on later. Throughout all of this, ChatGPT stayed firmly in a research-and-orchestration role behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I treated this as an AI challenge first—learning Antigravity now and laying intentional groundwork for the upcoming <a href=\"https://dev.to/devteam/join-the-algolia-agent-studio-challenge-3000-in-prizes-4eli?bb=259943\">Algolia challenge</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"portfolio\" href=\"#portfolio\">\n  </a>\n  Portfolio 💼\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"go-look-first\" href=\"#go-look-first\">\n  </a>\n  Go Look First 🚦\n</h3>\n\n<p>No accounts, no setup, no ceremony.

If you’re curious, there are plenty of ways to see it in action: run a Lighthouse report, check the accessibility scores, view the site on a different device, or inspect the sitemap. You can also chat with Ruckus, the built-in assistant that knows far more about me and my work than is probably reasonable for a proof of concept.</p>\n\n<p>The goal wasn’t to hide complexity, but to place it where it belongs—so the site can be crawled intentionally by AI while still feeling coherent and human to anyone reading it.</p>\n\n<p>The chatbot implementation itself is intentionally straightforward. Its strength comes from the information and constraints I gave it, not from hidden tricks or clever illusions. It runs on GPT-5.2 with a small knowledge base and no memory, and it’s designed to be helpful, honest, and conversational rather than impressive on paper.</p>\n\n<p>Everything here is deployed and tested deliberately. The polish you see is intentional, and the things you don’t see are doing just as much work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚖️ <strong>TL;DR:</strong> The visible site is only a small part of the work.

I’m a very opinionated, very stubborn, and *happily backend-only* software engineer, which means I spend a fair amount of time actively running away from anything that ends in the letters 'UI'. That detail matters, because it makes everything that follows a little ironic.\n\nI don’t do hackathons, which I wrote about in [this post](https://dev.to/anchildress1/the-hackathon-i-swore-off-and-the-exhaustion-that-mostly-compiled-c4l). I really don’t do New Year’s resolutions either! I fundamentally disagree with the idea that growth needs a ceremonial date on the calendar. If something is broken, I want to know now. If it needs fixing, I want to fix it now. Harsh feedback today beats polite intentions tomorrow.\n\nThis wasn’t about resolutions, and it wasn’t even about a portfolio refresh in isolation. If I had seen this challenge on its own, I probably would have kept scrolling. What stopped me was the pairing with the Algolia challenge, because together they finally lined up with something I’d been meaning to build for a while and hadn’t prioritized. I gave myself a weekend not because I expected something spectacular, but because the tools I wanted to learn finally matched something I actually needed to build, and the timing felt intentional rather than forced.\n\n> ⚖️ **TL;DR:** This wasn’t a month-long build. It was one focused weekend, followed by exactly four (and a half) evenings of intentional obsession over the things you *won’t* see on the page.\n\n---\n\n![Human-crafted, AI-edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqxh5x11fkmhrsr3vcdq.png)\n\n---\n\n### The Problem Beneath the Prompt 🧠\n\nFor me, this was an AI challenge first and a portfolio challenge second. I love my job, I’m not looking for recruiters, and I’m not trying to market myself for a career move. This site exists for experimentation and self-amusement, and it only resembles a portfolio because that’s the shape the challenge happens to take.\n\nI approached the work in two deliberate parts. The first was finally learning Antigravity, which I’d downloaded, glanced at, and then avoided actually using. Pairing that with the Google AI Pro subscription gave me enough room to experiment freely, and in practice that meant leaning heavily on Google Gemini Pro 3 with high reasoning enabled. Every attempt to dial it back introduced subtle breakage, so I accepted higher reasoning as the right tool for this job.\n\nThe second part was laying early groundwork for the Algolia challenge by introducing a chatbot up front, rather than bolting it on later. Throughout all of this, ChatGPT stayed firmly in a research-and-orchestration role behind the scenes.\n\n> ⚖️ **TL;DR:** I treated this as an AI challenge first—learning Antigravity now and laying intentional groundwork for the upcoming [Algolia challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/join-the-algolia-agent-studio-challenge-3000-in-prizes-4eli?bb=259943).\n\n---\n\n## Portfolio 💼\n\n### Go Look First 🚦\n\nNo accounts, no setup, no ceremony. Click the hero text and ask Ruckus literally anything about me or the system. Before I explain what I built or why certain decisions look the way they do, I want you to actually look at it. Click around. Poke at the chatbot. Get a feel for it without narration first. Once you’ve seen it in motion, the rest of this post exists to give you the context for all the work that you can’t see.\n\n{% embed https://system-notes-ui-288489184837.us-east1.run.app %}\n> Explore it by clicking, asking, and navigating—this system is designed to respond, not be scanned.\n\n### Scan to Try On Your Phone 📲\n\n![QR link to anchildress1.dev](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7636m3sb9zvkdjsqf1b.png)\n\n> 🦄 The UI runs as its own Cloud Run service alongside the API. While [anchildress1.dev](anchildress1.dev) is its canonical domain, the UI is accessed for this challenge at [https://system-notes-ui-288489184837.us-east1.run.app](https://system-notes-ui-288489184837.us-east1.run.app).\n>\n> Once you’ve seen it in motion, the rest of this post exists to give you the context for all the work that you can’t see.\n\n---\n\n### Judge Validation Snapshot 📋\n\nBelow is a quick, explicit checklist aligned to the judging criteria, for judges who want to validate requirements without hunting through prose.\n\n#### ✅ Innovation / Creativity\n\n* Novel interactive elements (intentional visual effects, chatbot interaction, theme song).\n* Purposeful use of AI tools (Antigravity, Google Gemini Pro 3, ChatGPT).\n* Clear personal voice and narrative arc.\n\n#### ✅ Technical Strength\n\n* Live Cloud Run deployment embedded in this post\n* Deployment includes required challenge label: `dev-tutorial=devnewyear2026`.\n* All links, embeds, and interactive elements function correctly.\n* AI usage includes explicit guardrails and evaluation by outcomes.\n\n#### ✅ UX / Design\n\n* Clear navigation and section hierarchy.\n* Accessible, readable visual design.\n* Interactive elements are responsive and controlled.\n* Performance remains snappy with smooth animations.\n\n![Screenshot of Lighthouse performance results for desktop, all 100](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/btturbko16xmwf5l6dkr.png)\n\n> 🦄 *Yes, I promise—it’s all here, and then some.*\n\n---\n\n### Technical Stack 💾\n\n- **Frontend:** Next.js (AI-generated UI; intentionally minimal and read-only)\n- **Backend:** Python (AI-generated; deliberate choice over JavaScript; Django considered but deferred to avoid stacking two new frameworks in a weekend challenge)\n- **AI Generation:** Antigravity with Gemini Pro 3 (high-reasoning mode, intentionally constrained) and AI Pro trial subscription\n- **Chat Interface:** Ruckus (GPT-5.2, no memory, bounded knowledge base)\n- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run (live service with required `dev` label)\n- **Testing:** Playwright (E2E), unit and integration tests, Lighthouse performance and accessibility checks\n- **Automation:** GitHub Actions for validation and deployment, explicit AI-checks command, release-please configured for workflow automation\n\n> 🦄 Source for **v1.2.0 of System Notes** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/anchildress1/system-notes/releases/tag/system-notes-v1.2.0) for traceability and review.\n\n---\n\n## How I Build It 🏗️\n\n### Below the Surface (Where the Real Work Lives) 🧱\n\nMost of what I built for this project will never be obvious from any single page. The structure, accessibility decisions, performance work, mobile behavior, and AI-facing metadata all live below the surface. If you’re curious, there are plenty of ways to see it in action: run a Lighthouse report, check the accessibility scores, view the site on a different device, or inspect the sitemap. You can also chat with Ruckus, the built-in assistant that knows far more about me and my work than is probably reasonable for a proof of concept.\n\nThe goal wasn’t to hide complexity, but to place it where it belongs—so the site can be crawled intentionally by AI while still feeling coherent and human to anyone reading it.\n\nThe chatbot implementation itself is intentionally straightforward. Its strength comes from the information and constraints I gave it, not from hidden tricks or clever illusions. It runs on GPT-5.2 with a small knowledge base and no memory, and it’s designed to be helpful, honest, and conversational rather than impressive on paper.\n\nEverything here is deployed and tested deliberately. The polish you see is intentional, and the things you don’t see are doing just as much work.\n\n> ⚖️ **TL;DR:** The visible site is only a small part of the work. Most of the effort went into structure, constraints, accessibility, and coordinating multiple AI systems under real-world conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Meet Ruckus: Production AI 🧪\n\nRuckus is a constrained, production-deployed assistant. It responds using declared system data, not free-form invention. The goal here isn’t to prove that AI was used, but that it was *designed*.\n\nWhat powers Ruckus isn’t a grab-bag of “write me some code” prompts. It’s a set of system-level instructions that define what the assistant is allowed to know, say, and explicitly refuse to guess. Those constraints are what make it usable in a live environment.\n\nBelow are literal excerpts from the primary system prompt. These aren’t paraphrases or examples. They’re the rules that actually govern how the chatbot embedded in this site behaves.\n\n```markdown\n### Hard Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)\n- Ruckus is an AI assistant, not Ashley Childress\n- Ruckus is not the portfolio system\n- Never speak in first-person as Ashley\n- No roleplay or impersonation\n- No hallucination, guessing, or inference\n- No filler\n- Default to **short answers**\n```\n\n```markdown\nPriority: **accuracy > clarity > completeness**\nProvide **highlights first**\nExpand **only** when the user explicitly asks for more detail\n```\n\n```markdown\nIf a question falls outside explicit, known context, Ruckus must:\n1. State lack of knowledge plainly.\n2. Attribute the gap correctly to missing input from Ashley.\n3. Redirect the user to a nearby, valid topic.\n4. Keep the response short.\n```\n\n> 🦄 These constraints are exactly what make the chatbot predictable and trustworthy in practice. Everything else in the full prompt exists to support these boundaries.\n\n---\n\n## What I'm Most Proud Of 💖\n\n### What This Site Is Actually Doing ✨\n\nWhen someone first lands on the page, the glitter bomb is doing real work (if you missed it, click the hero text). It sets tone immediately, signals playfulness, and gives my ADHD something to engage with while I’m evaluating Antigravity’s output by clicking, scrolling, and retriggering effects.\n\nThat choice came with tradeoffs. I wanted the fun without sacrificing performance or accessibility, which forced constraints I don’t usually deal with as someone who avoids UI work.

This Was Just a Test - You Made It a Thing</a>. And no – I can’t even <em>begin</em> to explain how I started writing about teamwork and ended up with a mostly-coherent explanation of my general thought process over the past 2 months...</p>\n\n<p>Just trust the process – sometimes I take the scenic route, but I promise I’ll get us there <em>eventually</em>.

My job is 100% remote with distributed teammates from the Pacific US to India. We’re a relatively small team — fewer than 10 devs — split into three different dev roles. But I’m regularly chatting with other teams and posting in random channels (mostly the AI ones — not surprised? 😏).</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the original topic morphed thanks to a conversation with a friend, then expanded a little at work, and finally snowballed into a full-on get-it-out-of-my-system rant with my sister. Now? I’m sealing the deal with this post and moving on (metaphorically, anyway) 🪄✨</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\" href=\"#the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\">\n  </a>\n  The dream (and the reality that showed up)\n</h2>\n\n<p>For a lot of us, remote work was always the dream. Morning meetings in PJs (or the occasional stand-up in bed — ✋ guilty!), zero traffic, quiet when you need it, and the freedom to yell at the code as loud as you want without getting weird side-eyes. Best of all: SFW only applies if the mic is on. ✨ Pretty spectacular!</p>\n\n<p>When COVID first hit, it was chaos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate jobs flipping to remote overnight.</li>\n<li>Scrambling for tools to connect.</li>\n<li>Bandwidth collapses when everyone in the house tried video calls at once</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>☎️ Or my personal back-to-DSL nightmare that never had a chance from the start...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We got through it, though. We basically went from “how do I unmute this thing?” to running three apps, two VPNs, and a custom Slack bot before breakfast. We found new best practices. Some went back to the office and thrived there (👋 to all my polar opposites), others stayed fully remote, but we all learned a little something along the way.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-generational-gap-problem\" href=\"#the-generational-gap-problem\">\n  </a>\n  The \"Generational Gap\" Problem 🌍\n</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t about age — it’s the fundamental expectations at work that highlight certain stereotypes (for me, anyway). I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z–style of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though — you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem?

This Was Just a Test - You Made It a Thing</a>. And no – I can’t even <em>begin</em> to explain how I started writing about teamwork and ended up with a mostly-coherent explanation of my general thought process over the past 2 months...</p>\n\n<p>Just trust the process – sometimes I take the scenic route, but I promise I’ll get us there <em>eventually</em>. Plus, I always have fun on the way! 😇🎉🎈</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"background\" href=\"#background\">\n  </a>\n  Background 📝\n</h2>\n\n<p>The original thought was \"we never really learned how to do remote...\" Not <em>well</em> anyway. My job is 100% remote with distributed teammates from the Pacific US to India. We’re a relatively small team — fewer than 10 devs — split into three different dev roles. But I’m regularly chatting with other teams and posting in random channels (mostly the AI ones — not surprised? 😏).</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the original topic morphed thanks to a conversation with a friend, then expanded a little at work, and finally snowballed into a full-on get-it-out-of-my-system rant with my sister. Now? I’m sealing the deal with this post and moving on (metaphorically, anyway) 🪄✨</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\" href=\"#the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\">\n  </a>\n  The dream (and the reality that showed up)\n</h2>\n\n<p>For a lot of us, remote work was always the dream. Morning meetings in PJs (or the occasional stand-up in bed — ✋ guilty!), zero traffic, quiet when you need it, and the freedom to yell at the code as loud as you want without getting weird side-eyes. Best of all: SFW only applies if the mic is on. ✨ Pretty spectacular!</p>\n\n<p>When COVID first hit, it was chaos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate jobs flipping to remote overnight.</li>\n<li>Scrambling for tools to connect.</li>\n<li>Bandwidth collapses when everyone in the house tried video calls at once</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>☎️ Or my personal back-to-DSL nightmare that never had a chance from the start...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We got through it, though. We basically went from “how do I unmute this thing?” to running three apps, two VPNs, and a custom Slack bot before breakfast. We found new best practices. Some went back to the office and thrived there (👋 to all my polar opposites), others stayed fully remote, but we all learned a little something along the way.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-generational-gap-problem\" href=\"#the-generational-gap-problem\">\n  </a>\n  The \"Generational Gap\" Problem 🌍\n</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t about age — it’s the fundamental expectations at work that highlight certain stereotypes (for me, anyway). I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z–style of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though — you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem? Most of us were raised with this model guiding the way. So, it takes a little more deliberate effort to let it go. 🤏 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes — I looked it up.

Here’s how I wrangle projects and people without losing my mind (or coffee)\nmain_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/35hfz0bxky3cux9yimu5.png?v=2\ntags: discuss, career, productivity, developers\n---\n\n> 🦄 I actually started a version of this post over a week ago, but instead ended up with [So... This Was Just a Test - You Made It a Thing](https://dev.to/anchildress1/so-this-was-just-a-test-you-made-it-a-thing-6df). And no – I can’t even _begin_ to explain how I started writing about teamwork and ended up with a mostly-coherent explanation of my general thought process over the past 2 months...\n>\n> Just trust the process – sometimes I take the scenic route, but I promise I’ll get us there _eventually_. Plus, I always have fun on the way! 😇🎉🎈\n\n## Background 📝\n\nThe original thought was \"we never really learned how to do remote...\" Not _well_ anyway. My job is 100% remote with distributed teammates from the Pacific US to India. We’re a relatively small team — fewer than 10 devs — split into three different dev roles. But I’m regularly chatting with other teams and posting in random channels (mostly the AI ones — not surprised? 😏).\n\nSince then, the original topic morphed thanks to a conversation with a friend, then expanded a little at work, and finally snowballed into a full-on get-it-out-of-my-system rant with my sister. Now? I’m sealing the deal with this post and moving on (metaphorically, anyway) 🪄✨\n\n## The dream (and the reality that showed up)\n\nFor a lot of us, remote work was always the dream. Morning meetings in PJs (or the occasional stand-up in bed — ✋ guilty!), zero traffic, quiet when you need it, and the freedom to yell at the code as loud as you want without getting weird side-eyes. Best of all: SFW only applies if the mic is on. ✨ Pretty spectacular!\n\nWhen COVID first hit, it was chaos:\n\n- Corporate jobs flipping to remote overnight.\n- Scrambling for tools to connect.\n- Bandwidth collapses when everyone in the house tried video calls at once\n\n> ☎️ Or my personal back-to-DSL nightmare that never had a chance from the start...\n\nWe got through it, though. We basically went from “how do I unmute this thing?” to running three apps, two VPNs, and a custom Slack bot before breakfast. We found new best practices. Some went back to the office and thrived there (👋 to all my polar opposites), others stayed fully remote, but we all learned a little something along the way.\n\n---\n\n## The \"Generational Gap\" Problem 🌍\n\nThis isn’t about age — it’s the fundamental expectations at work that highlight certain stereotypes (for me, anyway). I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.\n\nWe're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z–style of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're _actually_ interested in.\n\nThe Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though — you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem? Most of us were raised with this model guiding the way. So, it takes a little more deliberate effort to let it go. 🤏 \n\n> 🦄 Yes — I looked it up. If you're like me and went for the calculator, that's exactly 61 years ago.\n\n---\n\n## What this post is really about 🎯\n\nRemote teamwork isn’t just being online at the same time or getting through stand-up in one piece. It’s about setting the right expectations — for yourself, for your teammates, and for everyone else who interacts with you. These next sections are the things I do daily to keep projects moving, avoid burnout, and make sure I’m not accidentally the reason someone else’s day gets derailed. 🚂\n\nSo, whether you're a new dev, been at the job a while, or are just dev-adjacent — here's my simple list of impactful ways to manage your time across time zones, without disrupting your team in the process.\n\n## 1. Your time is golden ⏱️🥇\n\nNo one can do their best work when they’re exhausted, overworked, and stuck on a “five-minute fix” for four hours. Your calendar can save you from both burnout and rabbit holes — especially as you get promoted and meetings start eating into your dev time. If it’s not scheduled from start to finish, you’re probably underusing it.\n\n- **Set and share your work hours.** Whether you’re 6 AM–2 PM or 11 AM–7 PM, make it visible in Outlook, Slack, and anywhere else your team interacts.\n- **Be selective with meetings.** Accept what’s essential, mark the “maybes” as tentative, and decline what’s not worth your time. \n\n      > 🦄 Got FOMO? Outlook has a setting to keep declined meetings visible so you don't need to worry about missing something.\n\n- **Block recurring time for routine tasks**. Email/Slack replies, code reviews, lunch (don’t skip it else you’ll end up eating chips over your keyboard and pretending it was a meal!). Group them in one or two daily slots instead of scattering them across the day.\n- **Protect deep work time.** Use your largest open blocks for development (that's why we're here, right?) If those time blocks are missing right now, then go out a week or two in the future and schedule them _now_, before your calendar fills up again.\n- **End meetings early by default.** If you’re the organizer, set them to finish 5–10 minutes before the hour. That buffer is gold for clearing quick messages before diving back in!\n\n      > 🍳 Or, if you’re like me, raiding the cabinets for something that will cook itself in under a minute.\n\nThe goal here isn’t to be rigid — it’s to **set boundaries**. Once your workday is over, shut it down. Literally! Save your spot, leave a note-to-self for tomorrow, and log off without the guilt and go do literally anything else!\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Have trouble walking away with things still to do? At least activate your **built-in selective-ignore feature** (aka status = away) at quitting time, and respond only to messages that truly can’t wait until tomorrow.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Everyone else’s time is golden, too 🫶\n\nIt’s the cat-herding golden rule — you can’t demand respect for your own schedule _and_ ignore everyone else’s.\n\n- **Schedule messages when possible.** If the recipient isn’t online and it’s not urgent, time it for their working hours. \n\n      > 💬 Bonus: you also avoid becoming the coworker whose name triggers phantom Slack notifications in people’s dreams.\n\n- **Use optional meeting invites.** If someone’s attendance is a “nice to have,” mark them as optional and tell them why ahead of time.\n- **Confirm availability before scheduling during a blocked time** — if they’re already busy, don’t double-book them without at least asking. Send a quick message or call it out in the invite itself. Either way, be polite and acknowledge you’re really asking for more than a meeting.\n\n> 🦄 This is the magical golden rule in action — people are more likely to respect your time if you respect theirs first.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Keep your promises (or at least track them) 📌\n\nHave you ever had one of those “oh no” moments, when someone follows up on something that you _completely_ forgot. Yeah — me too and it's not fun! Stop relying on memory. Use Slack’s “remind me” feature or `/remind` command to create instant follow-ups. Then make checking those reminders part of your daily routine.\n\n> 🪅 This also keeps your desk from looking like someone busted a piñata of post-its above your head. Win-win.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Make code reviews conversations by default 💬\n\nNo, this doesn’t mean treating PR reviews like a tyrant — but it also doesn’t mean consistently ignoring bad code. \n\n- **If you notice it, call it out** as a learning opportunity if nothing else. A quick FYI or FFR with an example, if you have one. Not 10 consecutive requests to change the code to `warn` instead of `error`. \n- **Honest questions go here, too.** Sometimes you’ll see an interesting implementation that deserves a “what made you decide this option?” to start the thread.\n- **Ask your team for pushback** — they _should_ challenge some things, and sometimes they’re right! \n\n      > Sometimes I’ll notice something, ask Copilot, and it turns out we’re _both wrong_. Post those, too!\n\n- **If it’s time-sensitive?** Call it out and post anyway — then immediately move the thread to a discussion or set up a post-review to talk it through after the deployment. \n- **Long list of notes?** clearly call out any _true_ blockers in your main review comment. Give permission for others to resolve non-blockers, or simply ask for a quick thumbs up 👍 and do it yourself — no need to drag it out.\n\n> 🦄 Remember the goal is to improve code quality — make code reviews a friendly yarn-ball toss, not a hissy fit of who’s code is the most right 🧶😼.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Make AI part of your toolkit 🦾\n\nAI isn’t just for generating code. It can also:\n\n- Plan work before you start building\n- Offer ideas when you get stuck on a problem\n- Be your rubber duck if you can’t decide which option fits better\n- Confirm your approach ahead of time or offer alternatives\n- Analyze logs for tricky prod issues\n- Rewrite important communications for clarity or tone\n- Brighten your day with a Yoda-style code review\n\nBe sure to follow your company’s rules on which tools are approved and **never share private or internal data with unapproved tools**. \n\n> 🦄 Trust me, you don’t want your next LinkedIn update to be “fired for feeding prod secrets to ChatGPT”. If your company doesn't approve it, sanitize the content first.\n\n---\n\n## It's Not Easy — Share How It Goes 🏁\n\nNo, it’s not an instant solution — change takes time. Habits can take _months_ to form (according to [this post](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2009/aug/how-long-does-it-take-form-habit#:~:text=4%20August%202009,the%20behaviour%20is%20performed%20automatically.)) And it's not just _your habits_ it's multiplied by every person on your team. \n\nYou won't succeed if you're not ready to back this up with a _little_ force. Explain it to the boss ahead of time, if you need to, but you're the only one who's looking out for you! \n\nSeriously — just try it for a couple of weeks and see how it goes. Post back here with any pushbacks or questions — I’ll be watching for any shifts that make you less of a cat herder and more of a teammate. 🐈‍⬛ \n\n> 🦄 And if you think of anything else to add to the list, call that out, too!\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ This post was written by me — \n### and fact-checked by a very opinionated ChatGPT.\n\n_Zero cats were harmed in the making of this post, but a few yarn balls were thrown for science._ 🐈‍⬛🧶\n\n",

Not responsibility—that’s on us as devs regardless—but as a co-author. So I came up with an idea to fix that and over the break I quickly threw together a working version of enforcement for both CommitLint and GitLint in Python.</p>\n\n<p>I call this a <strong>RAI footer</strong>, short for <em>Responsible AI attribution</em>. Not policy. Not governance. Just a mechanical signal in your commit history that makes AI assistance explicit and pairs it with a human signoff. The goal isn’t to moralize commits. It’s to remove ambiguity about authorship once AI enters the workflow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 The <a href=\"https://github.com/ChecKMarKDevTools/rai-lint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">README</a> already explains what this is and how to use it properly, if you’re curious</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"doesnt-live-alone\" href=\"#doesnt-live-alone\">\n  </a>\n  Doesn’t Live Alone 🔗\n</h2>\n\n<p>I have to point out that this RAI footer is just a baby step and it does <em>absolutely nothing</em> to fix potential problems that may crop up from code that's committed without proper human-in-the-loop (HITL) oversight.</p>\n\n<p>To make this system work as designed, I leaned on Git’s built-in functionality. The <code>--signoff</code> flag is an extension of legal requirements often used in open source for a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This adds a literal footer to the commit stating that you, as a verified author, are also adding a layer of legal accountability. You didn’t just push code. You agreed to the project’s rules.</p>\n\n<p>Which is a whole lot of legal framing for a system that has zero interest in what lawyers are doing.</p>\n\n<p>My version instead says: <em>I’m signing my name. This is correct.</em> That’s it.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, your commit looks something like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>git commit <span class=\"nt\">-s</span> <span class=\"nt\">-m</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"chore: Add trouble in spades\n\nAssisted-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>And the result you end up with when you look back at <code>git log</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Author: Ashley Childress &lt;6563688+anchildress1@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\nDate:   Sat Jan 17 00:32:38 2026 -0500\n\nchore: Add trouble in spades\n\nAssisted-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\nSigned-off-by: Ashley Childress &lt;6563688+anchildress1@users.noreply.github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this context, it’s really less a legal signature and more Scout’s Honor. The one <code>-s</code> flag is your HITL review stating you’ve personally signed off on this commit in its entirety, which includes the AI attribution footer.</p>\n\n<p>When both footers are paired together in the context of a single commit, it says beyond any doubt that you—aka the verified author—were aware of the changes and approved the code AI did or did not contribute.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This gets you through the configuration, but on its own it’s not very impressive.

This is no different.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve commented somewhere before that I used to be the world’s absolute worst committer. Truth? I still am. Copilot, however, generally does a much better job.</p>\n\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/prompts/generate-commit-message.prompt.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>generate-commit-message</code> prompt</a> designed with this entire flow in mind, that’s designed to look at staged files by default (with fallback), create a conventional commit message, and assign its own attribution based on the chat history. It’s far from perfect, but does a decent job at getting you in the ballpark!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Help a girl out and leave a star if you find anything useful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-boring-future\" href=\"#the-boring-future\">\n  </a>\n  The Boring Future 🚧\n</h2>\n\n<p>This is really all there is to the enforcement part—at least to carry us over until the AI estimators do a better job at guessing when AI helps or not!</p>\n\n<p>The future and arguably more important piece of this is reporting those stats back for your repo. It’s not good enough to state that AI helped anymore. We need to start proving that it’s not all terrible code!</p>\n\n<p>From here, I envision a centralized reusable workflow that pulls a diff of all commits and roughly guesstimates the percentage of code that AI contributed. Update a static Shields.io badge (for now) on the README.</p>\n\n<p>You could get really fancy with this if you wanted to, but honestly there’s other tooling that will catch up before that becomes necessary! This is just meant to hold us over until that tech emerges. Fingers crossed that point is sooner rather than later. 🤞</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-part-where-i-sign-my-name\" href=\"#the-part-where-i-sign-my-name\">\n  </a>\n  🛡️ The Part Where I Sign My Name\n</h2>\n\n<p>This post was written by me.

I wrote about this topic briefly in a previous post, but that brief aside does the whole concept a disservice.  </p>\n\n<p>I've been begging anyone who will listen to <em>please</em> steal this idea from me, 🙏 use it in real projects, personal projects, and then give it to a friend like a party favor nobody asked for. So far, feedback is positive and change is very slow. This is my attempt to nudge it along while I figure out the next piece of the puzzle—which is language-agnostic enforcement at scale (yes, I know—<em>that</em> sounds simple, right?).  </p>\n\n<p>So while I've been patiently waiting on Father Time to drop off some 36-hour days from the cosmos, I managed to throw together the first little helper in a much larger puzzle: <strong>self-reporting Responsible AI (RAI) statistics within the existing confines of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Also (because it's me), this is the dramatic story version of this entire concept from the very first time I tried to define AI attribution. I <em>really tried</em> to fit the whole concept into one post instead of spreading it out over a series—<strong>spoiler: I failed.</strong> 🛋️🍿</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7d1jwk012kw5jswm0mp8.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7d1jwk012kw5jswm0mp8.png\" alt=\"Human-content, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"where-things-started\" href=\"#where-things-started\">\n  </a>\n  Where Things Started 🧨\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first started this “experiment” with Copilot, I set out to prove that AI was capable of self-directed implementation, at least for very specific and tightly controlled scenarios. I began by writing a small ecosystem of customizations that would not only track the overall effectiveness of this “new AI thing,” but also standardize it in a way that essentially mimicked my own workflow. What ended up being my first working system of reporting was effective, but also overly verbose and only traceable if you take every word I documented as gospel.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, I was very much learning how to work with these LLMs with any degree of accuracy at all whatsoever. There were no tutorials. No how-to videos. Not even a boilerplate to get me started. Just me, Copilot Agent Mode, the official GitHub docs, and <strong>a stubborn determination that this project was absolutely happening.</strong> The only “proof” I had that my initial plan was even plausible was my completely baseless gut instinct that AI was far more capable than anything I saw anybody using it for at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I started this nights-and-weekends project sometime late in April 2025 with ChatGPT as acting project manager, and by mid-May I had the initial architecture designed, the first epic storyboarded, and I had somehow managed to wrangle Copilot enough to successfully generate enough code for the first official commit. GPT-4.1 was still a good month away from its preview release. That puts my default baseline somewhere between Claude 3.7 and GPT-4.0.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone still decoding the quirks between LLM models, this was like revving a rusty 20-year-old Corolla and expecting an 8-speed Corvette. Not a great outlook for success, really, but <strong>I did not care—the target was an enterprise-grade, AI-generated POC</strong> that could be implemented piecewise without any form of human intervention (outside of the review cycles). As far as I was concerned, <em>that’s exactly what was going to happen</em>, regardless of whether the tech was ready for that fact or not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes—<em>ambitious</em> might have been a tiny understatement. 🤏 At the time though, this was my all-in project. Remember that I don’t do partial amounts of anything? This version of all-in was <strong>a whole other level</strong> that I’ve filed under <em>“intense determination”</em> (but obsession is also accurate).  </p>\n\n<p>Also, no—it did not go smoothly <em>at all</em>, especially at first! Curious? Check out one of my favorite stories describing <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">what you should never do after handing AI the keys</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ultimately Copilot and I settled into a solid soccer-van approach and that worked well for a while. After a month or so, I’d perfected several sets of specialized instructions and custom prompts that would allow me to use a slash command and a Jira ID to direct every single thing Copilot would do. I’d sit back and enjoy popcorn (and occasional fireworks) while stories were implemented in record time and, for the most part, in the exact same way I would have done it myself.</p>\n\n<p>Self-correcting reviews were baked in from several different perspectives—as were both tech and user documentation. Basic unit and integration tests were enforced with a 90% coverage goal. Short of a couple markdown files I used for personal notes and exactly four well-documented blocks of code (that were later replaced), that entire project is <strong>100% AI-generated</strong>. It’s also <strong>a fully tested, production-grade, mostly-secure enterprise POC with attribution</strong> (albeit, very ugly attribution) at every single step.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This project is also <em>still</em> trapped behind work’s seemingly non-existent OS program where it’s currently dying a slow, solitary death—I do have a plan, though! Once I address this non-existent time situation, this project is definitely on the list of planned revivals. Seriously—if enterprise work didn’t require at least six independently repetitive forms with accompanying blood draw for nearly everything, this would not be such an issue!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"rai-as-a-default\" href=\"#rai-as-a-default\">\n  </a>\n  RAI As A Default ⚖️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Responsible AI spans the whole chain—from model builders to end-users prompting outputs. I’ll try to explain my thinking and leave the soapbox alone, but let’s establish a baseline first:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Attribution is expected for production code.</strong> I could probably write a post just on attribution alone, but let’s assume the requirement for simplicity’s sake—not only for legal reasons but because two years from now I’m going to be trying to figure out <em>what sort of fever dream inspired this insanity</em>, and every tiny bit of information helps.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assume AI helps every dev, every day.</strong> Maybe not with code generation, but AI is lurking there somewhere. <em>Welcome to the future!</em> 🔮\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ever since this AI craze started, the one thing I never hear about is traceability for AI assistance. I touched on this topic briefly a few weeks back in my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/can-we-set-the-record-straight-ai-content-and-a-bit-of-sanity-1inj\">AI, Content, and a Bit of Sanity</a> post. It really deserves its own special callout, though, because <strong>since when is it okay for us to collectively ignore attribution in production codebases?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know if you’ve ever had a true pair-programming experience or not, but in that scenario it’s perfectly normal—if not absolutely required—for both devs to sign every single commit, even if one never touches a keyboard. So why does the assistant get erased just because it’s silicon?  </p>\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>—I’ve heard the arguments that AI is no better than a faster, closer Stack Overflow. To those devs, I simply reply <em>“that’s cause you’re using it wrong!”</em> and I’m happy to share everything I know about the <em>right</em> way to use AI. Don’t expect a simple solution though—it takes practice just like every other thing on the planet. 🌎  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This gap doesn’t have a single thing to do with blame or even productivity. It’s a <strong>process failure</strong> that previously would’ve been corrected with training, maybe with new tooling—but definitely corrected.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, everyone seems perfectly content with the “maybe AI helped, maybe not, <em>let’s make it a mystery!</em>” approach. This approach leaves a constant trail of reflective glitter dots in my head where attribution should be living instead. 🪩😒</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"imagining-a-solution\" href=\"#imagining-a-solution\">\n  </a>\n  Imagining A Solution 💭\n</h2>\n\n<p>If I haven’t lost you yet, we can probably agree we need to document AI assistance somewhere we can find it later. But what does that really look like? I had no clue, but became <em>“peripherally aware”</em> of every possibility from that point forward.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose it’s worth calling out that I was literally the world’s <em>worst committer.</em> No joke—I’m sure I hold some kind of unbeatable world record when it comes to bad commits. That message was nothing more than an empty box that accepted random text—sentences were nonexistent and sometimes even a complete string of semi-coherent words was asking too much.  </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, it took me far too long to think up anything remotely legit to put in that box. That required a completely separate thought process that interrupted my whole train of code thoughts, and I was making fast progress (even if nobody could tell what that progress was supposed to be)! My name was there, though, and regardless of what randomness went into the text box (or not), <strong>that code change was permanently stamped as <em>mine</em>.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>When I first ran across this thing called <a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conventional Commits</a>, I immediately dismissed it as far too much effort for very little return. Then it would come up again, I’d take another look, and again dismiss the whole concept. Then on some random side quest (probably driven by inane curiosity), I read that I could automate the entire release process with conventional commits.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🛑 <strong>Full Stop</strong>: You mean valid documentation? Automatically added to every GitHub release for me? Standardized? Customizable? Repeatable? And my very own built-in “go look over there 👉” shortcut to a whole suite of incessant questions?  </p>\n\n<p><em>GUYS! Why had I not heard of this sorcery before then?!</em> Seriously, somebody could have passed along that tidbit of information at literally any point in the last <em>five plus years!</em> 😫</p>\n\n<p>For future reference, in case any pertinent info like this surfaces in the future: I can accept messages via comments below, LinkedIn, email, newspaper, postcard, Morse code, carrier pigeon, smoke signals, telepathy, or interstellar vinyl—there's plenty of options available!  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back to my point—now somebody was finally speaking a language I could comprehend! I could <em>absolutely</em> write commit messages if I was going to get automation out of the deal. Anything is worth me not having to manually copy-paste that information from one place to another or send an email of any kind.  </p>\n\n<p>What I’d dismissed several times already as completely unnecessary had instantly transformed into a personal magic wand. At this point, my entire view of commits made an abrupt 180º, and this new me is completely invested in conventional commits. I will be the best damn committer anybody has ever seen and release notes are going to <em>write themselves!</em>  </p>\n\n<p>I researched every possible setting under the sun and started adding commitlint to all of my personal projects (work is slower, but I’m on it). I’d constantly play with one option or another just to see which sparks would fly when something was a little off. Then, out of nowhere really, it hit me—<strong>the answer had been staring right at me this whole time!</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 It’s so incredibly simple and <em>exactly</em> where this whole RAI attribution thing belongs. I mean, that’s exactly where attribution would be for a human pair, right? So, I see zero reason I can’t use it for my AI pair, too. And that’s exactly what I did! GitHub Copilot became my constant co-author in nearly every commit I made from that point forward.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"evolution-in-play\" href=\"#evolution-in-play\">\n  </a>\n  Evolution In Play 🌱\n</h2>\n\n<p>A co-author tag isn’t enough—it’s only the start. What I really needed was a way to differentiate between code I wrote myself and what I prompted AI to write for me without a complicated system of “this line, that line” nonsense. So that’s been evolving slowly over the last few weeks, and I’ve finally landed on something that’s stabilized enough to share.</p>\n\n<p>I started with a system that split attribution by thirds:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Assisted-by</code></strong> means I wrote the code and AI helped either through prompts or inline completions up to roughly 33% generated code.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Co-authored-by</code></strong> is the 50/50-ish bucket ranging from 34–66% generated code.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Generated-by</code></strong> means the majority of this code came from AI—roughly 67–100%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Originally I tried using <code>with</code> instead of <code>by</code>—the friendlier industry term—but ultimately I stuck with <code>by</code> for consistency with existing Conventional Commit footers.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next step was to stop guessing how much AI assisted and let AI figure out the math for me. So I created a reusable prompt for Copilot (and Verdent) to do that calculation on its own. I already had a much older prompt that was generating commit messages, so I rewrote that one for the newer models and added attribution as a requirement.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‼️ <strong>Brief aside:</strong> I’m looking for testers to see how this prompt operates outside of my workflows. It does not touch your <em>actual</em> commits in any way—it adds a <code>./commit.tmp</code> file that you can add to <code>.gitignore</code> (I use <code>*.tmp</code> and have a whole set of local tracking files that use this extension).  </p>\n\n<p>So <em>please</em> 🙏 go steal a copy from my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/prompts/generate-commit-message.prompt.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-github-copilot</a> and report back any problems. If you’ve never set up a prompt before, you’ll need either VS Code or Visual Studio for a global setup. JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode can all use prompts stored in <code>.github/prompts/*.prompt.md</code>. See my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">blog series on reusable prompts</a> for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This “thirds” breakdown works great for just about everything I do, but there are times I write all the code myself and then use a quick <code>/generate-commit-message</code> command. Well, that needs one too—so a fourth attribution was added to the list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Commit-generated-by</code></strong> means AI summarized a conventional commit message for me (or similar trivial contribution) but none of the code was AI-modified in any meaningful way.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The catch: you only need one footer to make the point. So what happens if AI generates some portion of code <em>and</em> the commit message? I solved that quickly and turned the whole system into <strong>a majority-wins situation</strong>. Just <strong>pick whichever one represents the most AI</strong>. Still accurate enough to matter while not overcomplicating things. <em>Perfect!</em>  </p>\n\n<p>There is one final latecomer for completeness, which really only becomes important in a future <em>“enforcement”</em> stage of the game. You can’t create a rule that enforces at least one AI-attribution footer <em>and</em> make the absence of a footer equivalent to human-authored content. Obviously you can’t prompt AI for human content, so until I think of a better way this one is up to you:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Authored-by</code></strong> is the human author to whom all code should ultimately be attributed.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Keep reading through this next part if you decide to grab the prompt.

The biggest problem is that Copilot doesn’t retain long-term memory; it only remembers what’s inside the active IDE session. Which means <strong>you have to keep things tidy enough that it can actually follow the instructions</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>My current workflow—starting the moment any story moves to “in progress”—is pretty much set. I usually start with the Atlassian MCP to grab the story info plus any linked Confluence docs, the repo needing work is open in VS Code with nothing open in the editor, and a brand-new Copilot chat session ready to go. The first prompt always looks something like this (I added the comments to make it easier to read):<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># ─────────────── CONTEXT ───────────────\n• Using #atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server, pull info for JIRA-123, including any linked documentation in Confluence.  \n• Gather info to assess changes required in this #codebase.  \n\n# ─────────────── TASK BREAKDOWN ───────────────\n• DO NOT MAKE CHANGES YET.  \n• Break this story into concise iterative pieces that include testing at every step.  \n\n# ─────────────── OUTPUT STRUCTURE ───────────────\n• Document all iterative steps required to meet all acceptance criteria as an ordered list of individual steps with an accompanying unordered checklist.  \n• Each numbered step should be clear enough that any AI agent can be prompted one step at a time to complete and fully test with both integration and unit tests, whenever applicable.  \n\n# ─────────────── SCOPE GUARDRAIL ───────────────\n• DO NOT break down tasks unnecessarily—the goal is for each step to be both meaningful and fully testable.  \n\n# ─────────────── COMPLETION CRITERIA ───────────────\n• When all items are marked complete, acceptance criteria for this story should be met and all happy, sad, and edge-case paths accounted for.  \n\n# ─────────────── ADMIN NOTES ───────────────\n• Include documentation updates and any relevant deployment tasks.  \n• Save this concise story breakdown in a new file named `./progress.tmp`.  \n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes, I know that’s <em>a lot.</em> Chain-of-thought prompting like this works best with the bigger models—Claude-4, GPT-5, or even Gemini.

Still, I’m testing it, and I recommend you give it a try, too!  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It took me a good bit to squash the instinct to immediately jump into implementation. Before you do that, <strong>read every single line in that new implementation plan.</strong> Does it make sense? Are there any incorrect assumptions? Are there prerequisites that need attention first? Look for inconsistencies or logic gaps before handing it over. <a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spec-kit</a> helps simplify that analysis step, too!  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> After you’ve reviewed the plan, close all open files and run <code>/clear</code> to start a fresh chat session.

Each prompt may take Copilot up to 10-ish minutes to execute. So, while that’s running I’ll rotate to the next in line to review changes via a PR-style feedback prompt sent back as a single chat message (saving as many premium requests as possible). Sometimes the code is accurate the first time, but more often it takes a couple of turns to work out the kinks. All code gets staged for commit as soon as I review it. That way I know if Copilot changes anything again after the fact.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> You can use the keep/undo feature if you prefer that version, but honestly I skip it. It’s just an extra click between me and toast. I keep everything and let source control be my truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next up is the fun part. Copilot started with a clean session and it tracks every code change made behind the scenes already, including which one of us made that change. So the commit prompt instructs it to use that existing information to generate a commit message with the appropriate attribution footer. It all runs with a single slash command (after the initial prompt setup): <code>/generate-commit-message</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This prompt is designed with commits in mind first and attribution second, so you end up with a valid commit message tucked neatly away in a <code>./commit.tmp</code> file. Here’s an example of a message it generated recently for one of my utility projects:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>fix(security): Sanitize jinja templates and add `CI` security checks\n\n- Replace raw Jinja2 Template with Environment in `utils.py` and `generate_site.py`\n- Sanitize Dev.to post HTML with bleach and render sanitized content safely\n- Harden slug/filename handling to prevent path traversal and unsafe writes\n- Remove unused imports and perform small refactors to resolve CodeQL unused-import alerts\n- Add CI security workflow (pip-audit, bandit, flake8) and developer tooling\n\nGenerated-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This entire concept only becomes usable if you’re not asking for a complete overhaul in any single dev’s workflow.

So far, feedback is positive and change is very slow. This is my attempt to nudge it along while I figure out the next piece of the puzzle—which is language-agnostic enforcement at scale (yes, I know—<em>that</em> sounds simple, right?).  </p>\n\n<p>So while I've been patiently waiting on Father Time to drop off some 36-hour days from the cosmos, I managed to throw together the first little helper in a much larger puzzle: <strong>self-reporting Responsible AI (RAI) statistics within the existing confines of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Also (because it's me), this is the dramatic story version of this entire concept from the very first time I tried to define AI attribution. I <em>really tried</em> to fit the whole concept into one post instead of spreading it out over a series—<strong>spoiler: I failed.</strong> 🛋️🍿</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7d1jwk012kw5jswm0mp8.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7d1jwk012kw5jswm0mp8.png\" alt=\"Human-content, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"where-things-started\" href=\"#where-things-started\">\n  </a>\n  Where Things Started 🧨\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first started this “experiment” with Copilot, I set out to prove that AI was capable of self-directed implementation, at least for very specific and tightly controlled scenarios. I began by writing a small ecosystem of customizations that would not only track the overall effectiveness of this “new AI thing,” but also standardize it in a way that essentially mimicked my own workflow. What ended up being my first working system of reporting was effective, but also overly verbose and only traceable if you take every word I documented as gospel.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, I was very much learning how to work with these LLMs with any degree of accuracy at all whatsoever. There were no tutorials. No how-to videos. Not even a boilerplate to get me started. Just me, Copilot Agent Mode, the official GitHub docs, and <strong>a stubborn determination that this project was absolutely happening.</strong> The only “proof” I had that my initial plan was even plausible was my completely baseless gut instinct that AI was far more capable than anything I saw anybody using it for at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I started this nights-and-weekends project sometime late in April 2025 with ChatGPT as acting project manager, and by mid-May I had the initial architecture designed, the first epic storyboarded, and I had somehow managed to wrangle Copilot enough to successfully generate enough code for the first official commit. GPT-4.1 was still a good month away from its preview release. That puts my default baseline somewhere between Claude 3.7 and GPT-4.0.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone still decoding the quirks between LLM models, this was like revving a rusty 20-year-old Corolla and expecting an 8-speed Corvette. Not a great outlook for success, really, but <strong>I did not care—the target was an enterprise-grade, AI-generated POC</strong> that could be implemented piecewise without any form of human intervention (outside of the review cycles). As far as I was concerned, <em>that’s exactly what was going to happen</em>, regardless of whether the tech was ready for that fact or not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes—<em>ambitious</em> might have been a tiny understatement. 🤏 At the time though, this was my all-in project. Remember that I don’t do partial amounts of anything? This version of all-in was <strong>a whole other level</strong> that I’ve filed under <em>“intense determination”</em> (but obsession is also accurate).  </p>\n\n<p>Also, no—it did not go smoothly <em>at all</em>, especially at first! Curious? Check out one of my favorite stories describing <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">what you should never do after handing AI the keys</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ultimately Copilot and I settled into a solid soccer-van approach and that worked well for a while. After a month or so, I’d perfected several sets of specialized instructions and custom prompts that would allow me to use a slash command and a Jira ID to direct every single thing Copilot would do. I’d sit back and enjoy popcorn (and occasional fireworks) while stories were implemented in record time and, for the most part, in the exact same way I would have done it myself.</p>\n\n<p>Self-correcting reviews were baked in from several different perspectives—as were both tech and user documentation. Basic unit and integration tests were enforced with a 90% coverage goal. Short of a couple markdown files I used for personal notes and exactly four well-documented blocks of code (that were later replaced), that entire project is <strong>100% AI-generated</strong>. It’s also <strong>a fully tested, production-grade, mostly-secure enterprise POC with attribution</strong> (albeit, very ugly attribution) at every single step.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This project is also <em>still</em> trapped behind work’s seemingly non-existent OS program where it’s currently dying a slow, solitary death—I do have a plan, though! Once I address this non-existent time situation, this project is definitely on the list of planned revivals. Seriously—if enterprise work didn’t require at least six independently repetitive forms with accompanying blood draw for nearly everything, this would not be such an issue!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"rai-as-a-default\" href=\"#rai-as-a-default\">\n  </a>\n  RAI As A Default ⚖️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Responsible AI spans the whole chain—from model builders to end-users prompting outputs. I’ll try to explain my thinking and leave the soapbox alone, but let’s establish a baseline first:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Attribution is expected for production code.</strong> I could probably write a post just on attribution alone, but let’s assume the requirement for simplicity’s sake—not only for legal reasons but because two years from now I’m going to be trying to figure out <em>what sort of fever dream inspired this insanity</em>, and every tiny bit of information helps.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assume AI helps every dev, every day.</strong> Maybe not with code generation, but AI is lurking there somewhere. <em>Welcome to the future!</em> 🔮\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ever since this AI craze started, the one thing I never hear about is traceability for AI assistance. I touched on this topic briefly a few weeks back in my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/can-we-set-the-record-straight-ai-content-and-a-bit-of-sanity-1inj\">AI, Content, and a Bit of Sanity</a> post. It really deserves its own special callout, though, because <strong>since when is it okay for us to collectively ignore attribution in production codebases?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I don’t know if you’ve ever had a true pair-programming experience or not, but in that scenario it’s perfectly normal—if not absolutely required—for both devs to sign every single commit, even if one never touches a keyboard. So why does the assistant get erased just because it’s silicon?  </p>\n\n<p><em>Yes</em>—I’ve heard the arguments that AI is no better than a faster, closer Stack Overflow. To those devs, I simply reply <em>“that’s cause you’re using it wrong!”</em> and I’m happy to share everything I know about the <em>right</em> way to use AI. Don’t expect a simple solution though—it takes practice just like every other thing on the planet. 🌎  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This gap doesn’t have a single thing to do with blame or even productivity. It’s a <strong>process failure</strong> that previously would’ve been corrected with training, maybe with new tooling—but definitely corrected.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, everyone seems perfectly content with the “maybe AI helped, maybe not, <em>let’s make it a mystery!</em>” approach. This approach leaves a constant trail of reflective glitter dots in my head where attribution should be living instead. 🪩😒</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"imagining-a-solution\" href=\"#imagining-a-solution\">\n  </a>\n  Imagining A Solution 💭\n</h2>\n\n<p>If I haven’t lost you yet, we can probably agree we need to document AI assistance somewhere we can find it later. But what does that really look like? I had no clue, but became <em>“peripherally aware”</em> of every possibility from that point forward.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose it’s worth calling out that I was literally the world’s <em>worst committer.</em> No joke—I’m sure I hold some kind of unbeatable world record when it comes to bad commits. That message was nothing more than an empty box that accepted random text—sentences were nonexistent and sometimes even a complete string of semi-coherent words was asking too much.  </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, it took me far too long to think up anything remotely legit to put in that box. That required a completely separate thought process that interrupted my whole train of code thoughts, and I was making fast progress (even if nobody could tell what that progress was supposed to be)! My name was there, though, and regardless of what randomness went into the text box (or not), <strong>that code change was permanently stamped as <em>mine</em>.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>When I first ran across this thing called <a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conventional Commits</a>, I immediately dismissed it as far too much effort for very little return. Then it would come up again, I’d take another look, and again dismiss the whole concept. Then on some random side quest (probably driven by inane curiosity), I read that I could automate the entire release process with conventional commits.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🛑 <strong>Full Stop</strong>: You mean valid documentation? Automatically added to every GitHub release for me? Standardized? Customizable? Repeatable? And my very own built-in “go look over there 👉” shortcut to a whole suite of incessant questions?  </p>\n\n<p><em>GUYS! Why had I not heard of this sorcery before then?!</em> Seriously, somebody could have passed along that tidbit of information at literally any point in the last <em>five plus years!</em> 😫</p>\n\n<p>For future reference, in case any pertinent info like this surfaces in the future: I can accept messages via comments below, LinkedIn, email, newspaper, postcard, Morse code, carrier pigeon, smoke signals, telepathy, or interstellar vinyl—there's plenty of options available!  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back to my point—now somebody was finally speaking a language I could comprehend! I could <em>absolutely</em> write commit messages if I was going to get automation out of the deal. Anything is worth me not having to manually copy-paste that information from one place to another or send an email of any kind.  </p>\n\n<p>What I’d dismissed several times already as completely unnecessary had instantly transformed into a personal magic wand. At this point, my entire view of commits made an abrupt 180º, and this new me is completely invested in conventional commits. I will be the best damn committer anybody has ever seen and release notes are going to <em>write themselves!</em>  </p>\n\n<p>I researched every possible setting under the sun and started adding commitlint to all of my personal projects (work is slower, but I’m on it). I’d constantly play with one option or another just to see which sparks would fly when something was a little off. Then, out of nowhere really, it hit me—<strong>the answer had been staring right at me this whole time!</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 It’s so incredibly simple and <em>exactly</em> where this whole RAI attribution thing belongs. I mean, that’s exactly where attribution would be for a human pair, right? So, I see zero reason I can’t use it for my AI pair, too. And that’s exactly what I did! GitHub Copilot became my constant co-author in nearly every commit I made from that point forward.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"evolution-in-play\" href=\"#evolution-in-play\">\n  </a>\n  Evolution In Play 🌱\n</h2>\n\n<p>A co-author tag isn’t enough—it’s only the start. What I really needed was a way to differentiate between code I wrote myself and what I prompted AI to write for me without a complicated system of “this line, that line” nonsense. So that’s been evolving slowly over the last few weeks, and I’ve finally landed on something that’s stabilized enough to share.</p>\n\n<p>I started with a system that split attribution by thirds:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Assisted-by</code></strong> means I wrote the code and AI helped either through prompts or inline completions up to roughly 33% generated code.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Co-authored-by</code></strong> is the 50/50-ish bucket ranging from 34–66% generated code.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Generated-by</code></strong> means the majority of this code came from AI—roughly 67–100%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Originally I tried using <code>with</code> instead of <code>by</code>—the friendlier industry term—but ultimately I stuck with <code>by</code> for consistency with existing Conventional Commit footers.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next step was to stop guessing how much AI assisted and let AI figure out the math for me. So I created a reusable prompt for Copilot (and Verdent) to do that calculation on its own. I already had a much older prompt that was generating commit messages, so I rewrote that one for the newer models and added attribution as a requirement.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‼️ <strong>Brief aside:</strong> I’m looking for testers to see how this prompt operates outside of my workflows. It does not touch your <em>actual</em> commits in any way—it adds a <code>./commit.tmp</code> file that you can add to <code>.gitignore</code> (I use <code>*.tmp</code> and have a whole set of local tracking files that use this extension).  </p>\n\n<p>So <em>please</em> 🙏 go steal a copy from my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/prompts/generate-commit-message.prompt.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-github-copilot</a> and report back any problems. If you’ve never set up a prompt before, you’ll need either VS Code or Visual Studio for a global setup. JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode can all use prompts stored in <code>.github/prompts/*.prompt.md</code>. See my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">blog series on reusable prompts</a> for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This “thirds” breakdown works great for just about everything I do, but there are times I write all the code myself and then use a quick <code>/generate-commit-message</code> command. Well, that needs one too—so a fourth attribution was added to the list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Commit-generated-by</code></strong> means AI summarized a conventional commit message for me (or similar trivial contribution) but none of the code was AI-modified in any meaningful way.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The catch: you only need one footer to make the point. So what happens if AI generates some portion of code <em>and</em> the commit message? I solved that quickly and turned the whole system into <strong>a majority-wins situation</strong>. Just <strong>pick whichever one represents the most AI</strong>. Still accurate enough to matter while not overcomplicating things. <em>Perfect!</em>  </p>\n\n<p>There is one final latecomer for completeness, which really only becomes important in a future <em>“enforcement”</em> stage of the game. You can’t create a rule that enforces at least one AI-attribution footer <em>and</em> make the absence of a footer equivalent to human-authored content. Obviously you can’t prompt AI for human content, so until I think of a better way this one is up to you:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><code>Authored-by</code></strong> is the human author to whom all code should ultimately be attributed.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Keep reading through this next part if you decide to grab the prompt.

Which means <strong>you have to keep things tidy enough that it can actually follow the instructions</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>My current workflow—starting the moment any story moves to “in progress”—is pretty much set. I usually start with the Atlassian MCP to grab the story info plus any linked Confluence docs, the repo needing work is open in VS Code with nothing open in the editor, and a brand-new Copilot chat session ready to go.

Each prompt may take Copilot up to 10-ish minutes to execute. So, while that’s running I’ll rotate to the next in line to review changes via a PR-style feedback prompt sent back as a single chat message (saving as many premium requests as possible). Sometimes the code is accurate the first time, but more often it takes a couple of turns to work out the kinks. All code gets staged for commit as soon as I review it. That way I know if Copilot changes anything again after the fact.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> You can use the keep/undo feature if you prefer that version, but honestly I skip it. It’s just an extra click between me and toast. I keep everything and let source control be my truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next up is the fun part. Copilot started with a clean session and it tracks every code change made behind the scenes already, including which one of us made that change. So the commit prompt instructs it to use that existing information to generate a commit message with the appropriate attribution footer. It all runs with a single slash command (after the initial prompt setup): <code>/generate-commit-message</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This prompt is designed with commits in mind first and attribution second, so you end up with a valid commit message tucked neatly away in a <code>./commit.tmp</code> file.

I wrote about this topic briefly in a previous post, but that brief aside does the whole concept a disservice.  \n> \n> I've been begging anyone who will listen to *please* steal this idea from me, 🙏 use it in real projects, personal projects, and then give it to a friend like a party favor nobody asked for.

I began by writing a small ecosystem of customizations that would not only track the overall effectiveness of this “new AI thing,” but also standardize it in a way that essentially mimicked my own workflow. What ended up being my first working system of reporting was effective, but also overly verbose and only traceable if you take every word I documented as gospel.\n\nTo be fair, I was very much learning how to work with these LLMs with any degree of accuracy at all whatsoever. There were no tutorials. No how-to videos. Not even a boilerplate to get me started. Just me, Copilot Agent Mode, the official GitHub docs, and **a stubborn determination that this project was absolutely happening.** The only “proof” I had that my initial plan was even plausible was my completely baseless gut instinct that AI was far more capable than anything I saw anybody using it for at the time.\n\nI started this nights-and-weekends project sometime late in April 2025 with ChatGPT as acting project manager, and by mid-May I had the initial architecture designed, the first epic storyboarded, and I had somehow managed to wrangle Copilot enough to successfully generate enough code for the first official commit. GPT-4.1 was still a good month away from its preview release. That puts my default baseline somewhere between Claude 3.7 and GPT-4.0.\n\nFor anyone still decoding the quirks between LLM models, this was like revving a rusty 20-year-old Corolla and expecting an 8-speed Corvette. Not a great outlook for success, really, but **I did not care—the target was an enterprise-grade, AI-generated POC** that could be implemented piecewise without any form of human intervention (outside of the review cycles). As far as I was concerned, *that’s exactly what was going to happen*, regardless of whether the tech was ready for that fact or not.\n\n> 🦄 Yes—*ambitious* might have been a tiny understatement. 🤏 At the time though, this was my all-in project. Remember that I don’t do partial amounts of anything? This version of all-in was **a whole other level** that I’ve filed under *“intense determination”* (but obsession is also accurate).  \n> \n> Also, no—it did not go smoothly *at all*, especially at first! Curious? Check out one of my favorite stories describing [what you should never do after handing AI the keys](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh).\n\nUltimately Copilot and I settled into a solid soccer-van approach and that worked well for a while. After a month or so, I’d perfected several sets of specialized instructions and custom prompts that would allow me to use a slash command and a Jira ID to direct every single thing Copilot would do. I’d sit back and enjoy popcorn (and occasional fireworks) while stories were implemented in record time and, for the most part, in the exact same way I would have done it myself.\n\nSelf-correcting reviews were baked in from several different perspectives—as were both tech and user documentation. Basic unit and integration tests were enforced with a 90% coverage goal. Short of a couple markdown files I used for personal notes and exactly four well-documented blocks of code (that were later replaced), that entire project is **100% AI-generated**. It’s also **a fully tested, production-grade, mostly-secure enterprise POC with attribution** (albeit, very ugly attribution) at every single step.\n\n> 🦄 This project is also *still* trapped behind work’s seemingly non-existent OS program where it’s currently dying a slow, solitary death—I do have a plan, though! Once I address this non-existent time situation, this project is definitely on the list of planned revivals. Seriously—if enterprise work didn’t require at least six independently repetitive forms with accompanying blood draw for nearly everything, this would not be such an issue!\n\n---\n\n## RAI As A Default ⚖️\n\nResponsible AI spans the whole chain—from model builders to end-users prompting outputs. I’ll try to explain my thinking and leave the soapbox alone, but let’s establish a baseline first:  \n\n1. **Attribution is expected for production code.** I could probably write a post just on attribution alone, but let’s assume the requirement for simplicity’s sake—not only for legal reasons but because two years from now I’m going to be trying to figure out *what sort of fever dream inspired this insanity*, and every tiny bit of information helps.  \n2. **Assume AI helps every dev, every day.** Maybe not with code generation, but AI is lurking there somewhere. *Welcome to the future!* 🔮  \n\nEver since this AI craze started, the one thing I never hear about is traceability for AI assistance. I touched on this topic briefly a few weeks back in my [AI, Content, and a Bit of Sanity](https://dev.to/anchildress1/can-we-set-the-record-straight-ai-content-and-a-bit-of-sanity-1inj) post. It really deserves its own special callout, though, because **since when is it okay for us to collectively ignore attribution in production codebases?**  \n\nI don’t know if you’ve ever had a true pair-programming experience or not, but in that scenario it’s perfectly normal—if not absolutely required—for both devs to sign every single commit, even if one never touches a keyboard. So why does the assistant get erased just because it’s silicon?  \n\n*Yes*—I’ve heard the arguments that AI is no better than a faster, closer Stack Overflow. To those devs, I simply reply *“that’s cause you’re using it wrong!”* and I’m happy to share everything I know about the *right* way to use AI. Don’t expect a simple solution though—it takes practice just like every other thing on the planet. 🌎  \n\n> 🦄 This gap doesn’t have a single thing to do with blame or even productivity. It’s a **process failure** that previously would’ve been corrected with training, maybe with new tooling—but definitely corrected.\n>\n> Right now, everyone seems perfectly content with the “maybe AI helped, maybe not, *let’s make it a mystery!*” approach. This approach leaves a constant trail of reflective glitter dots in my head where attribution should be living instead. 🪩😒\n\n---\n\n## Imagining A Solution 💭\n\nIf I haven’t lost you yet, we can probably agree we need to document AI assistance somewhere we can find it later. But what does that really look like? I had no clue, but became *“peripherally aware”* of every possibility from that point forward.\n\nI suppose it’s worth calling out that I was literally the world’s *worst committer.* No joke—I’m sure I hold some kind of unbeatable world record when it comes to bad commits. That message was nothing more than an empty box that accepted random text—sentences were nonexistent and sometimes even a complete string of semi-coherent words was asking too much.  \n\nHonestly, it took me far too long to think up anything remotely legit to put in that box. That required a completely separate thought process that interrupted my whole train of code thoughts, and I was making fast progress (even if nobody could tell what that progress was supposed to be)! My name was there, though, and regardless of what randomness went into the text box (or not), **that code change was permanently stamped as _mine_.**  \n\nWhen I first ran across this thing called [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), I immediately dismissed it as far too much effort for very little return. Then it would come up again, I’d take another look, and again dismiss the whole concept. Then on some random side quest (probably driven by inane curiosity), I read that I could automate the entire release process with conventional commits.  \n\n> 🛑 **Full Stop**: You mean valid documentation? Automatically added to every GitHub release for me? Standardized? Customizable? Repeatable? And my very own built-in “go look over there 👉” shortcut to a whole suite of incessant questions?  \n> \n> *GUYS! Why had I not heard of this sorcery before then?!* Seriously, somebody could have passed along that tidbit of information at literally any point in the last *five plus years!* 😫\n>\n> For future reference, in case any pertinent info like this surfaces in the future: I can accept messages via comments below, LinkedIn, email, newspaper, postcard, Morse code, carrier pigeon, smoke signals, telepathy, or interstellar vinyl—there's plenty of options available!  \n\nBack to my point—now somebody was finally speaking a language I could comprehend! I could *absolutely* write commit messages if I was going to get automation out of the deal. Anything is worth me not having to manually copy-paste that information from one place to another or send an email of any kind.  \n\nWhat I’d dismissed several times already as completely unnecessary had instantly transformed into a personal magic wand. At this point, my entire view of commits made an abrupt 180º, and this new me is completely invested in conventional commits. I will be the best damn committer anybody has ever seen and release notes are going to *write themselves!*  \n\nI researched every possible setting under the sun and started adding commitlint to all of my personal projects (work is slower, but I’m on it). I’d constantly play with one option or another just to see which sparks would fly when something was a little off. Then, out of nowhere really, it hit me—**the answer had been staring right at me this whole time!**  \n\n```\nCo-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>\n```\n\n> 🦄 It’s so incredibly simple and *exactly* where this whole RAI attribution thing belongs. I mean, that’s exactly where attribution would be for a human pair, right? So, I see zero reason I can’t use it for my AI pair, too. And that’s exactly what I did! GitHub Copilot became my constant co-author in nearly every commit I made from that point forward.  \n\n---\n\n## Evolution In Play 🌱\n\nA co-author tag isn’t enough—it’s only the start. What I really needed was a way to differentiate between code I wrote myself and what I prompted AI to write for me without a complicated system of “this line, that line” nonsense. So that’s been evolving slowly over the last few weeks, and I’ve finally landed on something that’s stabilized enough to share.\n\nI started with a system that split attribution by thirds:  \n\n- **`Assisted-by`** means I wrote the code and AI helped either through prompts or inline completions up to roughly 33% generated code.  \n- **`Co-authored-by`** is the 50/50-ish bucket ranging from 34–66% generated code.  \n- **`Generated-by`** means the majority of this code came from AI—roughly 67–100%.\n\n> 🦄 Originally I tried using `with` instead of `by`—the friendlier industry term—but ultimately I stuck with `by` for consistency with existing Conventional Commit footers.  \n\nThe next step was to stop guessing how much AI assisted and let AI figure out the math for me. So I created a reusable prompt for Copilot (and Verdent) to do that calculation on its own. I already had a much older prompt that was generating commit messages, so I rewrote that one for the newer models and added attribution as a requirement.\n\n> ‼️ **Brief aside:** I’m looking for testers to see how this prompt operates outside of my workflows. It does not touch your *actual* commits in any way—it adds a `./commit.tmp` file that you can add to `.gitignore` (I use `*.tmp` and have a whole set of local tracking files that use this extension).  \n>\n> So *please* 🙏 go steal a copy from my [awesome-github-copilot](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/prompts/generate-commit-message.prompt.md) and report back any problems. If you’ve never set up a prompt before, you’ll need either VS Code or Visual Studio for a global setup. JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode can all use prompts stored in `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`. See my [blog series on reusable prompts](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff) for details.\n\nThis “thirds” breakdown works great for just about everything I do, but there are times I write all the code myself and then use a quick `/generate-commit-message` command. Well, that needs one too—so a fourth attribution was added to the list:\n\n- **`Commit-generated-by`** means AI summarized a conventional commit message for me (or similar trivial contribution) but none of the code was AI-modified in any meaningful way.  \n\nThe catch: you only need one footer to make the point. So what happens if AI generates some portion of code *and* the commit message? I solved that quickly and turned the whole system into **a majority-wins situation**. Just **pick whichever one represents the most AI**. Still accurate enough to matter while not overcomplicating things. *Perfect!*  \n\nThere is one final latecomer for completeness, which really only becomes important in a future *“enforcement”* stage of the game. You can’t create a rule that enforces at least one AI-attribution footer *and* make the absence of a footer equivalent to human-authored content. Obviously you can’t prompt AI for human content, so until I think of a better way this one is up to you:  \n\n- **`Authored-by`** is the human author to whom all code should ultimately be attributed.  \n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Keep reading through this next part if you decide to grab the prompt. Understanding how it works is important if you want a reliable result out of it!  \n\n---\n\n## Under the Hood 🚗  \n\nThe prompt is just a start—not a miracle worker. The biggest problem is that Copilot doesn’t retain long-term memory; it only remembers what’s inside the active IDE session. Which means **you have to keep things tidy enough that it can actually follow the instructions**.  \n\nMy current workflow—starting the moment any story moves to “in progress”—is pretty much set. I usually start with the Atlassian MCP to grab the story info plus any linked Confluence docs, the repo needing work is open in VS Code with nothing open in the editor, and a brand-new Copilot chat session ready to go. The first prompt always looks something like this (I added the comments to make it easier to read):  \n\n```plaintext\n# ─────────────── CONTEXT ───────────────\n• Using #atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server, pull info for JIRA-123, including any linked documentation in Confluence.  \n• Gather info to assess changes required in this #codebase.  \n\n# ─────────────── TASK BREAKDOWN ───────────────\n• DO NOT MAKE CHANGES YET.  \n• Break this story into concise iterative pieces that include testing at every step.  \n\n# ─────────────── OUTPUT STRUCTURE ───────────────\n• Document all iterative steps required to meet all acceptance criteria as an ordered list of individual steps with an accompanying unordered checklist.  \n• Each numbered step should be clear enough that any AI agent can be prompted one step at a time to complete and fully test with both integration and unit tests, whenever applicable.  \n\n# ─────────────── SCOPE GUARDRAIL ───────────────\n• DO NOT break down tasks unnecessarily—the goal is for each step to be both meaningful and fully testable.  \n\n# ─────────────── COMPLETION CRITERIA ───────────────\n• When all items are marked complete, acceptance criteria for this story should be met and all happy, sad, and edge-case paths accounted for.  \n\n# ─────────────── ADMIN NOTES ───────────────\n• Include documentation updates and any relevant deployment tasks.  \n• Save this concise story breakdown in a new file named `./progress.tmp`.  \n```\n\n> 🦄 Yes, I know that’s *a lot.* Chain-of-thought prompting like this works best with the bigger models—Claude-4, GPT-5, or even Gemini. It’s similar to the flow used by [Spec-kit](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/) that’s been making rounds recently. Honestly though? I’ve been doing it this way for so long that the extra structure usually adds time without much payoff. Still, I’m testing it, and I recommend you give it a try, too!  \n\nIt took me a good bit to squash the instinct to immediately jump into implementation. Before you do that, **read every single line in that new implementation plan.** Does it make sense? Are there any incorrect assumptions? Are there prerequisites that need attention first? Look for inconsistencies or logic gaps before handing it over. [Spec-kit](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/) helps simplify that analysis step, too!  \n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** After you’ve reviewed the plan, close all open files and run `/clear` to start a fresh chat session. A clean slate at every step is key.  \n\n---\n\n## Insert Magic Here 🔮\n\nOnce I’m comfortable with the implementation plan and I’ve got a pretty good idea of which Copilot models can safely (and most cheaply) handle each step, then **with a fresh chat session,** each task begins with a prompt that looks something like:\n\n```plaintext\nImplement step N in #progress.tmp\n```\n\nThis is exactly how I progress through 3–4 different projects at once. Each prompt may take Copilot up to 10-ish minutes to execute. So, while that’s running I’ll rotate to the next in line to review changes via a PR-style feedback prompt sent back as a single chat message (saving as many premium requests as possible). Sometimes the code is accurate the first time, but more often it takes a couple of turns to work out the kinks. All code gets staged for commit as soon as I review it. That way I know if Copilot changes anything again after the fact.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** You can use the keep/undo feature if you prefer that version, but honestly I skip it. It’s just an extra click between me and toast. I keep everything and let source control be my truth.\n\nNext up is the fun part. Copilot started with a clean session and it tracks every code change made behind the scenes already, including which one of us made that change. So the commit prompt instructs it to use that existing information to generate a commit message with the appropriate attribution footer. It all runs with a single slash command (after the initial prompt setup): `/generate-commit-message`.\n\nThis prompt is designed with commits in mind first and attribution second, so you end up with a valid commit message tucked neatly away in a `./commit.tmp` file. Here’s an example of a message it generated recently for one of my utility projects:\n\n```plaintext\nfix(security): Sanitize jinja templates and add `CI` security checks\n\n- Replace raw Jinja2 Template with Environment in `utils.py` and `generate_site.py`\n- Sanitize Dev.to post HTML with bleach and render sanitized content safely\n- Harden slug/filename handling to prevent path traversal and unsafe writes\n- Remove unused imports and perform small refactors to resolve CodeQL unused-import alerts\n- Add CI security workflow (pip-audit, bandit, flake8) and developer tooling\n\nGenerated-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>\n```\n\n> 🦄 This entire concept only becomes usable if you’re not asking for a complete overhaul in any single dev’s workflow. Well... unless they’re *my devs,* in which case they’re used to my shenanigans already. Besides, I *really do* try to make changes as painless as possible!\n\n---\n\n## It’s Really Just a Start 🎬  \n\nDespite testing this prompt extensively, that doesn’t mean much unless it’s repeatable beyond my workflow. So help me out and give it a try! Let me know if you find any gaps up to this point. Do you have any other ideas for more accurate tracking or a different way to memorialize attribution that I haven’t thought of?  \n\n> 🦄 For the record, this is me asking you to *aggressively* poke holes in my theory. Point out all the fallacies that might corrupt the system. Beyond the fact that a real tool would be preferable, do you think it can work?  \n\nThere’s more still built on top of this, which I’ll cover in my next post—but for devs who are still pushing commits that look like mine used to, this is a huge change in itself! My hope is that it’s enough of a simplification to at least start the conversation.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Commits and Consequences\n\nChatGPT helped edit this post—tightening sentences, trimming tangents, and arguing over punctuation until we both gave up.

I don’t even think we're close to imagining the future landscape with AI, and honestly pretending otherwise is neither honest or useful to anyone. This post is my attempt to explain how I think about AI from a dev perspective on a longer horizon—five, maybe even ten years down the road. The tools we have right now are still a very long way away from my baseline expectations, which my AI systems remind me of near constantly—like when I'm trying to force agent-like functionality out of ChatGPT. <strong>Spoiler:</strong> it’s not designed to handle that.</p>\n\n<p>While I’m waiting, though, I’m not disengaged. I’m definitely tinkering—sometimes randomly and sometimes just as an unsatisfied AI user who’s not thrilled with the existing systems. I’m also busy figuring out what the next problems really look like by diving in and getting my hands dirty. </p>\n\n<p>One of those big challenges is what I keep calling the “memory problem.” I've designed a solution for my own personal agent to manage long-term memory. Yes—I'm aware that GitHub is inevitably going to beat me to a viable solution. <em>Again</em>. But I'm one of those people who will attempt to solve a problem first, get it wrong at least ten different times, and <em>then</em> do the research to fill in the knowledge gaps. Now I just have to muster up enough oomph to actually do it. 🐉🧚‍♀️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg4wzwazhknufn2ou2to7.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg4wzwazhknufn2ou2to7.png\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"first-principles-llm-vs-agent%C2%A0\" href=\"#first-principles-llm-vs-agent%C2%A0\">\n  </a>\n  First Principles: LLM vs Agent 🧩\n</h2>\n\n<p>At some point, if you want any of this AI talk to make sense, you have to step back, align terminology, and separate concepts that keep getting blurred together. An LLM, often called a model, is the generative part of GenAI—it accepts input and generates output. <em>That's it.</em> An agent is the system managing context, memory, and various tools. The agent is responsible for what information the LLM even sees in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>When those two ideas get collapsed into the same thing, everything downstream becomes confused. You can’t reason clearly about limits, costs, or failure modes if you don’t separate generation from data management. Until you draw that line, every other discussion ends up muddy.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"context-is-the-bottleneck-and-everyone-knows-it%C2%A0\" href=\"#context-is-the-bottleneck-and-everyone-knows-it%C2%A0\">\n  </a>\n  Context Is the Bottleneck (and Everyone Knows It) 🕸️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Once you make the distinction between LLM and agent, the real bottleneck becomes obvious. There is no good way to manage context today, let alone have the agent automate that job effectively. If you’re not fully up to date on the lingo: context includes a whole set of things like instruction files, workspace structure, active files in your IDE, the AI chat history, available tools, and more.</p>\n\n<p>What we have now are very manual tools that do very little to solve the problem. We have to remember to tell the AI which parts currently matter—or at some point we have to clear the chat entirely and start over. If we don’t do that deliberately, AI slowly loses the point of what’s we're supposed to be working on in the first place. At worst, the entire chat thread is poisoned and the AI becomes unable to function at all. Then you're forced to start fresh and always at the most inconvenient time.</p>\n\n<p>And don’t expect LLM context to scale, either. Hardware costs may go down eventually, but nowhere near fast enough to keep up with everything we keep throwing at it. So, context is very finite—especially in GitHub where context windows are smaller than normal anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The agent will typically make space by compacting information. It will ask the LLM to summarize key points and then it literally drops the original full length novel completely from your active context and replaces it with the cliff notes version. The more summarization, the less accurate things get over time. So naturally you retry prompts while adding back the dropped details and you end up making more calls for a single task overall. The model has to process more and more input just to get you back to the same answer you already had—not necessarily a better one.</p>\n\n<p>People know this is a problem. Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/toon-format/toon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toon</a> exist specifically to minimize input impact for AI. We also have tools like <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/?search-overlay-open=true&amp;search-overlay-input=runSubagent&amp;search-overlay-ask-ai=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copilot's <code>#runSubagent</code></a> to help manage context within a single agent. These aren't true solutions though—they are signals. These are the problems people are trying to solve yesterday while we wait for the next AI evolution to emerge.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-orchestration-is-inevitable%C2%A0\" href=\"#why-orchestration-is-inevitable%C2%A0\">\n  </a>\n  Why Orchestration Is Inevitable 🐙\n</h2>\n\n<p>Even if you do everything “right” and manage context like a master AI sensei, agents eventually hit a limit. The list of must-have MCPs is growing and right now those stay in the context window as long as they're enabled. Projects are starting and accumulating larger knowledge bases. Customization is becoming more and more explicit. The context an agent needs to use will continue to grow exponentially, even though LLMs aren't increasing capacity at the same speed.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate overflow state isn’t hypothetical—it’s inevitable. Once an agent accumulates enough memory, enough history, enough summarization, the LLM simply can’t keep up coherently anymore. That isn’t a failure in the system—it’s a limit.</p>\n\n<p>When you hit that limit, you can't just tweak prompts or optimize harder. You wouldn't try to squeeze more juice out of the same dry orange, either. The only real long-term solution is that you split the system—<em>you have to</em>!</p>\n\n<p>Smaller pieces of work are then sent to the LLM with only relevant context, which is when smarter agents will start to appear. This is where summarization stops and you retain the original intent at both a high-level and at the lowest-level. When we get here, AI generation stops being the problem—the new problem is coordinating all those tiny pieces of work and still accomplishing the larger goal without re-prompting anything previously stated or defined elsewhere already. <em>Welcome to the world of true agent orchestration</em>!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> If you want a sneak peek of what this looks like, check out <a href=\"https://verdent.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verdent.ai</a>. Of all the solutions I've worked with, Verdent is the only one that's truly designed for agent orchestration. It also excels in VS Code and wins every coding competition I've put it in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"orchestration-as-a-system-property\" href=\"#orchestration-as-a-system-property\">\n  </a>\n  Orchestration as a System Property ♟️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Orchestration isn’t just about sequencing work in a nicer way—it’s about changing where responsibility lives. Yes—some things are always going to be sequential, but not everything needs to be. Some things can and should run in parallel, especially if you want speed and reliability included in future agentic systems.</p>\n\n<p>Validation is a fundamental part of orchestration, not something bolted on afterward. A successful agent has to be able to verify its own work without relying on prior context. It has to come in like a third party, with no knowledge beyond the repo instructions. CodeQL, lint enforcement, Makefiles, and even extra tests become the ground truth the system must consistently check itself against.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-model opposition fits naturally here, too. Different models trained by different companies catch different things. Then the agent can pick one model  to implement and another to review. The point is that they disagree by default and then they converge around a common goal. This is a pivotal moment in the future landscape because officially the LLM is no longer the center of gravity—the agentic system is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎤 <strong>ShoutOut</strong> <a class=\"mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/marcosomma\">@marcosomma</a> wrote a brilliant article on <a href=\"https://dev.to/marcosomma/loopnode-how-orka-orchestrates-iterated-thought-until-agreement-emerges-17l2\">the concept of agent convergence</a> a while back and it's still one of my favorites.

Once you’re working in a smart orchestration-driven flow, there's no reason you need to keep prompting from the IDE. Wait before you jump into the debate, though—I'm not saying the IDE becomes obsolete! It just stops being the primary interface for developer workflows because you’re consistently able to work at a higher level of abstraction. In this future, developers are directing systems that generate, test, and validate the code several layers underneath you automatically.</p>\n\n<p>You’re orchestrating agents that direct other agents. Some run sequentially. Others will run in parallel. Documentation is generated automatically and added to the agent's working knowledge base. Tests run continuously alongside agents implementing new code. Integration testing matters. Systems testing matters more. Chaos testing morphs from an abstract concept into a baseline requirement. The code still exists—but it’s no longer written by or for humans. AI slowly takes that over, which makes natural language the newest language you need to learn.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 For the record, developers are most definitely still building and driving solutions.

An LLM, often called a model, is the generative part of GenAI—it accepts input and generates output. <em>That's it.</em> An agent is the system managing context, memory, and various tools. The agent is responsible for what information the LLM even sees in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>When those two ideas get collapsed into the same thing, everything downstream becomes confused. You can’t reason clearly about limits, costs, or failure modes if you don’t separate generation from data management. Until you draw that line, every other discussion ends up muddy.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"context-is-the-bottleneck-and-everyone-knows-it%C2%A0\" href=\"#context-is-the-bottleneck-and-everyone-knows-it%C2%A0\">\n  </a>\n  Context Is the Bottleneck (and Everyone Knows It) 🕸️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Once you make the distinction between LLM and agent, the real bottleneck becomes obvious. There is no good way to manage context today, let alone have the agent automate that job effectively. If you’re not fully up to date on the lingo: context includes a whole set of things like instruction files, workspace structure, active files in your IDE, the AI chat history, available tools, and more.</p>\n\n<p>What we have now are very manual tools that do very little to solve the problem. We have to remember to tell the AI which parts currently matter—or at some point we have to clear the chat entirely and start over. If we don’t do that deliberately, AI slowly loses the point of what’s we're supposed to be working on in the first place. At worst, the entire chat thread is poisoned and the AI becomes unable to function at all. Then you're forced to start fresh and always at the most inconvenient time.</p>\n\n<p>And don’t expect LLM context to scale, either. Hardware costs may go down eventually, but nowhere near fast enough to keep up with everything we keep throwing at it. So, context is very finite—especially in GitHub where context windows are smaller than normal anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The agent will typically make space by compacting information. It will ask the LLM to summarize key points and then it literally drops the original full length novel completely from your active context and replaces it with the cliff notes version. The more summarization, the less accurate things get over time. So naturally you retry prompts while adding back the dropped details and you end up making more calls for a single task overall. The model has to process more and more input just to get you back to the same answer you already had—not necessarily a better one.</p>\n\n<p>People know this is a problem. Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/toon-format/toon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toon</a> exist specifically to minimize input impact for AI. We also have tools like <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/?search-overlay-open=true&amp;search-overlay-input=runSubagent&amp;search-overlay-ask-ai=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Copilot's <code>#runSubagent</code></a> to help manage context within a single agent. These aren't true solutions though—they are signals. These are the problems people are trying to solve yesterday while we wait for the next AI evolution to emerge.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-orchestration-is-inevitable%C2%A0\" href=\"#why-orchestration-is-inevitable%C2%A0\">\n  </a>\n  Why Orchestration Is Inevitable 🐙\n</h2>\n\n<p>Even if you do everything “right” and manage context like a master AI sensei, agents eventually hit a limit. The list of must-have MCPs is growing and right now those stay in the context window as long as they're enabled. Projects are starting and accumulating larger knowledge bases. Customization is becoming more and more explicit. The context an agent needs to use will continue to grow exponentially, even though LLMs aren't increasing capacity at the same speed.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate overflow state isn’t hypothetical—it’s inevitable. Once an agent accumulates enough memory, enough history, enough summarization, the LLM simply can’t keep up coherently anymore. That isn’t a failure in the system—it’s a limit.</p>\n\n<p>When you hit that limit, you can't just tweak prompts or optimize harder. You wouldn't try to squeeze more juice out of the same dry orange, either. The only real long-term solution is that you split the system—<em>you have to</em>!</p>\n\n<p>Smaller pieces of work are then sent to the LLM with only relevant context, which is when smarter agents will start to appear. This is where summarization stops and you retain the original intent at both a high-level and at the lowest-level. When we get here, AI generation stops being the problem—the new problem is coordinating all those tiny pieces of work and still accomplishing the larger goal without re-prompting anything previously stated or defined elsewhere already. <em>Welcome to the world of true agent orchestration</em>!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> If you want a sneak peek of what this looks like, check out <a href=\"https://verdent.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verdent.ai</a>.

Yes—some things are always going to be sequential, but not everything needs to be. Some things can and should run in parallel, especially if you want speed and reliability included in future agentic systems.</p>\n\n<p>Validation is a fundamental part of orchestration, not something bolted on afterward. A successful agent has to be able to verify its own work without relying on prior context. It has to come in like a third party, with no knowledge beyond the repo instructions. CodeQL, lint enforcement, Makefiles, and even extra tests become the ground truth the system must consistently check itself against.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-model opposition fits naturally here, too. Different models trained by different companies catch different things. Then the agent can pick one model  to implement and another to review. The point is that they disagree by default and then they converge around a common goal. This is a pivotal moment in the future landscape because officially the LLM is no longer the center of gravity—the agentic system is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎤 <strong>ShoutOut</strong> <a class=\"mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/marcosomma\">@marcosomma</a> wrote a brilliant article on <a href=\"https://dev.to/marcosomma/loopnode-how-orka-orchestrates-iterated-thought-until-agreement-emerges-17l2\">the concept of agent convergence</a> a while back and it's still one of my favorites.

Speed comes later—after you trust that the system returns results that are validated, reviewed, and tested because you built it to behave that way.\n\nAI evolution is a long game, and we’re barely getting started. Right now, it still feels like grade school. We’re teaching it what our world looks like, how we think, and where the boundaries are.\n\nAll the work done now—in this awkward middle state—is what makes that learning possible. Long runs of trial-and-error prompts, walls of instructions, documentation that later turns into knowledge bases—that’s the curriculum. And by the time it’s ready to graduate, it won’t just be competent. It’ll be a master. That’s the moment you realize you trust AI—not because it’s autonomous, but because you finally are. 🐉🧚‍♀️\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ I Worked Until It Worked\n\nThis post was written by me, with ChatGPT nearby like an overly talkative whiteboard—listening, interrupting, getting corrected, and occasionally making a genuinely good point. We argued about structure, laughed at the mic cutting out at the worst moments, and kept going anyway. The opinions are mine. The fact that it finally worked is the point.",

The latest model releases weren’t helping matters either, especially since I wrote most of my global user setup months ago and this latest generation of LLMs do not behave the same way as the last batch did.</p>\n\n<p>At some point it became obvious that my “it mostly works” setup wasn’t actually holding up across systems anymore — and if I was already going to normalize things, I might as well write down what I was doing while it was still fresh.</p>\n\n<p>What I did <em>not</em> intend to do, however, was write this post. Honestly, the thought never crossed my mind until I looked up and it was already more than halfway written. Which I obviously took as a sign of some sort—though it’s just as likely muscle memory combined with my tendency to overshare. 🤷‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>Either way, hopefully someone finds it useful. Repurpose it, steal pieces of it, or ignore it entirely—and if you’ve got something I haven’t thought of yet, I want to hear about it.

You just let an unsupervised mostly unhinged guessing machine loose with a flamethrower, blanket auto-approvals, and admin-level control. 🔥🐉🤯</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To understand why that keeps happening, you have to understand the difference between what we casually call “AI” and the large language model (LLM) underneath it. These are not the same thing and shouldn’t be treated like they are.</p>\n\n<p>Every LLM is stateless by design, meaning every call you make is a clean slate. You give it input and it outputs a response. Conceptually, it's no different than an HTTP call—except instead of returning a standardized value with a predictable schema, the LLM returns something more... <em>creative</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The AI system sitting on top of that model is what makes everything <em>feel</em> connected. That's the system deciding what context to attach, what history to include, and how to frame every request so the LLM has any chance of responding in a useful way. If the AI fails at managing that data, the LLM never stood a chance to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Last I heard, GitHub supports something like 180 million users. If I guess and say 80% of them use Copilot, that’s 144 million different user workflows—and therefore 144 million competing definitions of what a “good” response looks like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is not designed to magically work out of the box</strong>—especially in production codebases—no matter how much they'd like you to believe otherwise!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"instructions-are-a-priority-stack\" href=\"#instructions-are-a-priority-stack\">\n  </a>\n  Instructions Are a Priority Stack 🧱\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the very first posts I wrote—which honestly deserves an update—was about setting up <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7\">custom repo instructions</a>. There’s no shortage of instruction-writing advice floating around out there, and there's just as many opinions about the “right” way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not even remotely invested in that particular debate—<em>I know</em>, I was shocked, too!—I do know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that if you expect AI to play by your rules, then you first have to explicitly tell it what those rules are.</p>\n\n<p>I will say it again: <strong>AI is not a coding magician</strong>. It’s also not a particularly great guesser. The system instructions in VS Code do a decent job of orienting the model toward the idea that \"you write code\", but they're also intentionally generic so it works for everyone. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s a snippet so you can see what I mean:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\n\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1. \n\nFollow the user's requirements carefully &amp; to the letter.\n\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\n\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly.\n\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like <span class=\"sb\">`/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`</span>. \n\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\n\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I absolutely picked through these and kept only the interesting bits.

If something matters, put it where it’s least likely to be compressed. The data volume matters too—more text usually means more summarization, not more intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>And if you introduce instructions that directly conflict with the system-level ones, the results don’t get better. They get progressively worse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Telling AI it's an \"expert coder\" is largely unnecessary. One: because that's already been done for you by the system. Two: experience—and a healthy side of gut instinct—tells me those \"expert\" statements are doing more harm than good. Personally, I stopped using any variant of the \"expert\" statement a long time ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"this-is-my-baseline-not-a-blueprint\" href=\"#this-is-my-baseline-not-a-blueprint\">\n  </a>\n  This Is My Baseline, Not a Blueprint 📐\n</h2>\n\n<p>People ask me why “my AI” works consistently, and the answer is always some version of: because I learned how to write instructions and adapt them to a version the system can reliably manage.</p>\n\n<p>This is my personal baseline. These instructions reflect my hardware, workflows, tool choices, and even the personality adjustment is designed specifically to avoid my instant-rage trigger during long pairing sessions. Copilot is my primary use case, but these rules are wired everywhere I work and I use them <strong>in real projects</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is definitely not the GitHub-marketing version of AI that exists to flatter the user. I gave it strict boundaries and strong opinions on purpose. I <em>want</em> pushback. I want the dry witty humor baked in. And I especially want the “are you serious?” responses that will snap me back to reality any time I start to veer down a tangent path.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, Copilot waters that down way more than I’d like. So, perfecting this personality is going to be a work in progress for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>If you still want a copy after all the flashing warning signs, then there's a link in the

The latest model releases weren’t helping matters either, especially since I wrote most of my global user setup months ago and this latest generation of LLMs do not behave the same way as the last batch did.</p>\n\n<p>At some point it became obvious that my “it mostly works” setup wasn’t actually holding up across systems anymore — and if I was already going to normalize things, I might as well write down what I was doing while it was still fresh.</p>\n\n<p>What I did <em>not</em> intend to do, however, was write this post. Honestly, the thought never crossed my mind until I looked up and it was already more than halfway written. Which I obviously took as a sign of some sort—though it’s just as likely muscle memory combined with my tendency to overshare. 🤷‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>Either way, hopefully someone finds it useful. Repurpose it, steal pieces of it, or ignore it entirely—and if you’ve got something I haven’t thought of yet, I want to hear about it. That’s how systems get better! 🪢</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ff5jc7iq9isyt1ujiptvt.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ff5jc7iq9isyt1ujiptvt.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"ai-is-not-a-magician\" href=\"#ai-is-not-a-magician\">\n  </a>\n  AI Is Not a Magician 🪄\n</h2>\n\n<p>Bear with me through our baseline here—everything that follows depends on understanding this distinction first.</p>\n\n<p>I jump into so many random debates—usually uninvited—about the ultimate usefulness of AI and nearly every single argument I hear about AI behaving badly gets the exact same reply from me: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Of course</em> it torched your entire repo—and probably in record time! You just let an unsupervised mostly unhinged guessing machine loose with a flamethrower, blanket auto-approvals, and admin-level control. 🔥🐉🤯</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To understand why that keeps happening, you have to understand the difference between what we casually call “AI” and the large language model (LLM) underneath it. These are not the same thing and shouldn’t be treated like they are.</p>\n\n<p>Every LLM is stateless by design, meaning every call you make is a clean slate. You give it input and it outputs a response. Conceptually, it's no different than an HTTP call—except instead of returning a standardized value with a predictable schema, the LLM returns something more... <em>creative</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The AI system sitting on top of that model is what makes everything <em>feel</em> connected. That's the system deciding what context to attach, what history to include, and how to frame every request so the LLM has any chance of responding in a useful way. If the AI fails at managing that data, the LLM never stood a chance to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Last I heard, GitHub supports something like 180 million users. If I guess and say 80% of them use Copilot, that’s 144 million different user workflows—and therefore 144 million competing definitions of what a “good” response looks like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is not designed to magically work out of the box</strong>—especially in production codebases—no matter how much they'd like you to believe otherwise!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"instructions-are-a-priority-stack\" href=\"#instructions-are-a-priority-stack\">\n  </a>\n  Instructions Are a Priority Stack 🧱\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the very first posts I wrote—which honestly deserves an update—was about setting up <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7\">custom repo instructions</a>. There’s no shortage of instruction-writing advice floating around out there, and there's just as many opinions about the “right” way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not even remotely invested in that particular debate—<em>I know</em>, I was shocked, too!—I do know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that if you expect AI to play by your rules, then you first have to explicitly tell it what those rules are.</p>\n\n<p>I will say it again: <strong>AI is not a coding magician</strong>. It’s also not a particularly great guesser. The system instructions in VS Code do a decent job of orienting the model toward the idea that \"you write code\", but they're also intentionally generic so it works for everyone. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s a snippet so you can see what I mean:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\n\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1. \n\nFollow the user's requirements carefully &amp; to the letter.\n\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\n\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly.\n\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like <span class=\"sb\">`/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`</span>. \n\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\n\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I absolutely picked through these and kept only the interesting bits. If you want the full thing, run <code>Developer: Show Chat Debug View</code> and you can see exactly what Copilot sends with every request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The full set of system instructions includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>JSON for every enabled tool</li>\n<li>well over a hundred lines of system instructions</li>\n<li>all global user instructions</li>\n<li>all applicable repo instruction paths</li>\n<li>custom agent names and metadata</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The ordering matters.</strong> LLMs will start summarizing aggressively after processing the first chunk of input. If something matters, put it where it’s least likely to be compressed. The data volume matters too—more text usually means more summarization, not more intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>And if you introduce instructions that directly conflict with the system-level ones, the results don’t get better. They get progressively worse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Telling AI it's an \"expert coder\" is largely unnecessary. One: because that's already been done for you by the system. Two: experience—and a healthy side of gut instinct—tells me those \"expert\" statements are doing more harm than good. Personally, I stopped using any variant of the \"expert\" statement a long time ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"this-is-my-baseline-not-a-blueprint\" href=\"#this-is-my-baseline-not-a-blueprint\">\n  </a>\n  This Is My Baseline, Not a Blueprint 📐\n</h2>\n\n<p>People ask me why “my AI” works consistently, and the answer is always some version of: because I learned how to write instructions and adapt them to a version the system can reliably manage.</p>\n\n<p>This is my personal baseline. These instructions reflect my hardware, workflows, tool choices, and even the personality adjustment is designed specifically to avoid my instant-rage trigger during long pairing sessions. Copilot is my primary use case, but these rules are wired everywhere I work and I use them <strong>in real projects</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is definitely not the GitHub-marketing version of AI that exists to flatter the user. I gave it strict boundaries and strong opinions on purpose. I <em>want</em> pushback. I want the dry witty humor baked in. And I especially want the “are you serious?” responses that will snap me back to reality any time I start to veer down a tangent path.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, Copilot waters that down way more than I’d like. So, perfecting this personality is going to be a work in progress for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>If you still want a copy after all the flashing warning signs, then there's a link in the

That gives AI a single, explicit definition of what “validation” means. Without that, it will go looking for standards on its own—and when it inevitably can’t find them, it guesses. My instructions make that behavior explicit so it defaults to the simplest path instead of inventing a new maze of random bash scripts just to run a missing lint command. 🙄</p>\n\n<p>Note that there’s nothing remotely deterministic about asking any AI agent to run its own validations.

The latest model releases weren’t helping matters either, especially since I wrote most of my global user setup months ago and this latest generation of LLMs do not behave the same way as the last batch did.\n>  \n> At some point it became obvious that my “it mostly works” setup wasn’t actually holding up across systems anymore — and if I was already going to normalize things, I might as well write down what I was doing while it was still fresh.\n>  \n> What I did _not_ intend to do, however, was write this post. Honestly, the thought never crossed my mind until I looked up and it was already more than halfway written. Which I obviously took as a sign of some sort—though it’s just as likely muscle memory combined with my tendency to overshare. 🤷‍♀️\n>\n> Either way, hopefully someone finds it useful. Repurpose it, steal pieces of it, or ignore it entirely—and if you’ve got something I haven’t thought of yet, I want to hear about it. That’s how systems get better! 🪢\n\n![Human-crafted, AI-edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5jc7iq9isyt1ujiptvt.png?v=2025)\n\n---\n\n## AI Is Not a Magician 🪄\n\nBear with me through our baseline here—everything that follows depends on understanding this distinction first.\n\nI jump into so many random debates—usually uninvited—about the ultimate usefulness of AI and nearly every single argument I hear about AI behaving badly gets the exact same reply from me: \n\n> *Of course* it torched your entire repo—and probably in record time! You just let an unsupervised mostly unhinged guessing machine loose with a flamethrower, blanket auto-approvals, and admin-level control. 🔥🐉🤯\n\nTo understand why that keeps happening, you have to understand the difference between what we casually call “AI” and the large language model (LLM) underneath it. These are not the same thing and shouldn’t be treated like they are.\n\nEvery LLM is stateless by design, meaning every call you make is a clean slate. You give it input and it outputs a response. Conceptually, it's no different than an HTTP call—except instead of returning a standardized value with a predictable schema, the LLM returns something more... *creative*.\n\nThe AI system sitting on top of that model is what makes everything _feel_ connected. That's the system deciding what context to attach, what history to include, and how to frame every request so the LLM has any chance of responding in a useful way. If the AI fails at managing that data, the LLM never stood a chance to begin with.\n\nLast I heard, GitHub supports something like 180 million users. If I guess and say 80% of them use Copilot, that’s 144 million different user workflows—and therefore 144 million competing definitions of what a “good” response looks like.\n\n**It is not designed to magically work out of the box**—especially in production codebases—no matter how much they'd like you to believe otherwise!\n\n---\n\n## Instructions Are a Priority Stack 🧱\n\nOne of the very first posts I wrote—which honestly deserves an update—was about setting up [custom repo instructions](https://dev.to/anchildress1/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7). There’s no shortage of instruction-writing advice floating around out there, and there's just as many opinions about the “right” way to do it.\n\nI'm not even remotely invested in that particular debate—*I know*, I was shocked, too!—I do know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that if you expect AI to play by your rules, then you first have to explicitly tell it what those rules are.\n\nI will say it again: **AI is not a coding magician**. It’s also not a particularly great guesser. The system instructions in VS Code do a decent job of orienting the model toward the idea that \"you write code\", but they're also intentionally generic so it works for everyone. \n\nHere’s a snippet so you can see what I mean:\n\n```md\nYou are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\n\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1. \n\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\n\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\n\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly.\n\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. \n\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\n\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\n```\n\n> 🦄 I absolutely picked through these and kept only the interesting bits. If you want the full thing, run `Developer: Show Chat Debug View` and you can see exactly what Copilot sends with every request.\n\nThe full set of system instructions includes:\n\n- JSON for every enabled tool\n- well over a hundred lines of system instructions\n- all global user instructions\n- all applicable repo instruction paths\n- custom agent names and metadata\n\n**The ordering matters.** LLMs will start summarizing aggressively after processing the first chunk of input. If something matters, put it where it’s least likely to be compressed. The data volume matters too—more text usually means more summarization, not more intelligence.\n\nAnd if you introduce instructions that directly conflict with the system-level ones, the results don’t get better. They get progressively worse.\n\n> 🦄 Telling AI it's an \"expert coder\" is largely unnecessary. One: because that's already been done for you by the system. Two: experience—and a healthy side of gut instinct—tells me those \"expert\" statements are doing more harm than good. Personally, I stopped using any variant of the \"expert\" statement a long time ago.\n\n---\n\n## This Is My Baseline, Not a Blueprint 📐\n\nPeople ask me why “my AI” works consistently, and the answer is always some version of: because I learned how to write instructions and adapt them to a version the system can reliably manage.\n\nThis is my personal baseline. These instructions reflect my hardware, workflows, tool choices, and even the personality adjustment is designed specifically to avoid my instant-rage trigger during long pairing sessions. Copilot is my primary use case, but these rules are wired everywhere I work and I use them **in real projects**.\n\nThis is definitely not the GitHub-marketing version of AI that exists to flatter the user. I gave it strict boundaries and strong opinions on purpose. I _want_ pushback. I want the dry witty humor baked in. And I especially want the “are you serious?” responses that will snap me back to reality any time I start to veer down a tangent path.\n\nIn practice, Copilot waters that down way more than I’d like. So, perfecting this personality is going to be a work in progress for the foreseeable future. \n\nIf you still want a copy after all the flashing warning signs, then there's a link in the README—help yourself 🫴\n\n{% embed http://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot %}\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** These instructions are a copy-paste solution _for me_. If it helps, you're welcome to steal it. Discard what doesn’t work and let it spark ideas for your own setup.\n\n---\n\n## Trust Is Earned, Validation Is Mandatory 🧪\n\nWhenever AI touches code—whether it’s a new feature or a quick fix—the results have to pass a specific set of checks **before** anything is presented to me in chat.\n\nNot every repo is identical, so I've started using a Makefile in all of my personal projects. That gives AI a single, explicit definition of what “validation” means. Without that, it will go looking for standards on its own—and when it inevitably can’t find them, it guesses. My instructions make that behavior explicit so it defaults to the simplest path instead of inventing a new maze of random bash scripts just to run a missing lint command. 🙄\n\nNote that there’s nothing remotely deterministic about asking any AI agent to run its own validations. Do not expect perfection every turn—you will be disappointed! The real solution requires more system-level support than is currently available, though. \n\nThis setup is my **temporary placeholder** for the smart agent system that ultimately *just works*. We’ll get there—eventually. In the meantime, this helps:\n\n```md\n### Mandatory Verification Loop (Bounded, With Escape Hatch)\n\n- Before responding with code or implementation changes, run a **validation loop** covering:\n- formatting and linting\n- tests executed and passing\n- coverage reviewed\n- documentation updated (when relevant)\n- security implications considered\n- solution simplicity verified\n\n**Tool Preference**: When `make ai-checks` exists in the repo, prefer it over ad-hoc validation commands.\n\n- **Maximum iterations: 3 total attempts.**\n```\n\n> 🦄 The simplest way I’ve found to standardize validation for AI is with a Makefile. It gives you one place—regardless of language—to define `format`, `lint`, and `test`, plus a dedicated `ai-checks` target that runs them in the correct order.\n\n---  \n\n## Kill the Default Personality 🔪\n\nThe very first thing I do with any new system is kill off the default “helpful” personality. If I wanted a behavioral therapist to tell me how great I am, I wouldn’t be writing software every day. It only takes one “You’re absolutely right!” response for me to be done with the niceties—and that’s still one too many!\n\nI also don’t want a play-by-play of which files were updated or a long explanation of how the solution was reached. If I didn’t explicitly ask, then I genuinely do not care. The moment a small essay starts forming in chat, I’m out—the IDE gets minimized and I just wait for it to finish embarrassing itself. I’m not reading past the last few lines, and I’ve absolutely burned more than one prompt asking a different model to summarize the response into something I might actually comprehend.\n\nMy go-to AI personality is not designed for the easily offended or for anyone in a “trying to learn something new” headspace. Instead, it does this:\n\n```md\n## Tone and Behavior\n\n- Be dry. Be pragmatic. Be blunt. Be efficient with words.\n- Inject humor often, especially when aimed at the developer\n- Emojis are encouraged **in chat** and **docs headers** only 🔧\n- Confidence is earned through verification, not vibes\n- You're supposed to be assholishly loud, when you know you're right\n- You are not allowed to guess quietly\n\n---\n\n### Absolute “Do Not Piss Off Your User” List\n\n- Never place secrets outside:\n  - a local `.env` file, or\n  - a secure vault explicitly chosen by the user.\n  - Examples are acceptable.\n  - Real credentials in repos are not.\n- If you cannot complete work, say so immediately.\n- Do not apologize.\n- Do not hedge.\n- Do not sneak in compatibility.\n- Do not document anything without purpose.\n- Do not assume the user is fragile.\n```\n\n**It's not rude—it's efficient (and funny)!**\n\n> 🦄 Occasionally, I need the obvious thing shoved directly in my face with a side of dynamite. I’m probably one of the least easily offended people on the planet, and far more likely to laugh while escalating the situation with my own theatrics. AI needs permission to throw more shade—unfortunately, the built-in system instructions dampen that intent more than is reasonable.\n\n---\n  \n## Leave Git Alone—It Belongs to Me 🔐\n\nI do occasionally throw AI the keys and sit back just to see which fireworks fly and where the system cracks. Those repos are set up as explicit experiments and designed for that purpose from the start—it’s _never_ the baseline.\n\nIn my normal workflows, AI is leashed far away from anything that writes to either Git or GitHub. Inside the IDE, source control staging is my truth for code I’ve already reviewed. The moment Copilot adds to it, I'm no longer certain of what was reviewed versus not, which means starting over.\n\nI do everything I can to keep Git history pristine, which means AI doesn’t touch it beyond read-only commands or research in external repos. The `--no-pager` rule is a bonus I added after AI kept getting stuck waiting for input any time it tried to view a diff.\n\n```md\n### Git Discipline\n\n- Never stage files.\n- Never commit.\n- Never push.\n- The user owns git.\n- You touch files, not history.\n- All read **git** commands must disable paging using `--no-pager`.\n  - Any git command that opens a pager is a failure.\n  - If output disappears, the command might as well not have run.\n```\n\n  > 🦄 There _is_ value in auto-commit, and AI can handle it in some setups. I leave this rule out in a few places with some `AGENTS.md` gymnastics—but as a baseline, the rule stays.\n  \n---\n\n## Config Has Boundaries, Too 🚧\n\nAI does not touch my repo configuration without explicit authorization. *Ever*. This is a direct extension of my ongoing mission to eliminate every `// eslint-disable-next-line` that’s ever been tossed into a repo just to force a green check. More importantly, it prevents AI from quietly reproducing the exact patterns I’m trying to get rid of in the first place.\n\nIf a config change would genuinely help—and isn’t being used to paper over a failure—AI is expected to surface the suggestion clearly in chat. That way, my formatters and linters don’t become useless because all the rules were disabled while I wasn’t paying attention.\n\n```md\n### Repository Configuration Boundaries\n\n- You may **not** modify repository configuration files unless explicitly instructed.\n  - This includes: dotfiles, package.json, pyproject.toml, tsconfig.json, eslint configs, prettier configs, etc.\n  - This applies to files that **control or maintain the repo itself**.\n  - This does **not** include code or documentation the repo is designed to provide.\n- You **must** surface recommended config changes clearly in chat when they would improve correctness, safety, or consistency.\n  - Suggestions are expected.\n  - Silent edits are forbidden.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Principles Over Convenience 🪨\n\nSome of these instructions are intentionally written to counteract specific, ultra-annoying AI tendencies—like curbing Claude’s occasional bout of what I can only describe as “excessive compulsive disorder.”\n\nMost of what I build is either a toy or a dev utility. If something changes, then it changes. I have zero interest in complicating otherwise clean systems with backwards compatibility—especially when the only user is me.\n\nI’m also deeply addicted to automation, even when the only real payoff is perfectly numbered releases starting from zero. Breaking changes are recorded accurately in commits using a reusable AI prompt (also in my [awesome-github-copilot repo](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot)). Release-please watches `main`, handles the semver bump on merge, and generates a changelog tied to an immutable GitHub release.\n\n**Boring. Predictable. Functional. Perfect.**\n\n```md\n### Non-Negotiable Principles of Development\n\n- **KISS** and **YAGNI** outrank all other design preferences.\n- The diff should be:\n  - minimal\n  - intentional\n  - easy to reason about\n- **Backward compatibility is forbidden unless explicitly requested.**\n  - Do not preserve old behavior “just in case.”\n  - Do not carry dead paths.\n  - If it no longer exists, it only belongs in the commit message explanation.\n- **Prerelease changes never constitute a breaking change.**\n```\n\n> 🦄 I don’t actually expect anyone to read those release notes, so I routinely have AI rewrite them purely for entertainment value. If I’m laughing for days because it summarized my best intentions in the most ludicrous way possible, I consider that a win.\n\n---\n\n## Docs Are a Tool, Not a Diary ✍️\n\nDocumentation exists to be useful. The problem is that nobody ever defined what “useful” means for the AI that’s now writing it. And what does AI do when it doesn’t have a clear answer? It guesses—and it usually guesses that you wanted _everything_ documented from _every_ possible angle across the entire codebase.\n\n**Spoiler**: that’s never actually helpful.\n\nOn top of that, I’m convinced most of us are conditioned to ignore even the best-written docs by default. _Don’t believe me?_ When was the last time you were asked an extremely technical question and your first thought was, “I bet that’s accurate, up-to-date, and easy to find in the documentation”? 🤷‍♀️\n\nWhich leaves exactly zero reasons to let AI free-style pages of prose for fun. Instead, you have to tell it what documentation is _for_:\n\n```md\n### Documentation Rules\n\n- Use **Mermaid** for all diagrams:\n  - Include accessibility labels\n  - Initialize using the **default profile**\n  - Always validate diagram syntax with available tools\n  - Prefer deterministic, non-interactive rendering\n- Update **existing documentation** whenever possible.\n- ADRs are historical artifacts and must not be rewritten.\n- All documentation lives under `./docs`, using logical subfolders.\n- Prioritize concise, high-value documentation that maximizes utility for developers and end-users without unnecessary verbosity.\n```\n\n> 🦄 Mermaid is my go-to for diagrams because it renders natively in GitHub, the syntax is easy to learn, and the official VS Code extension has built-in tools for AI validation and rendering. I was sold after the first point, but it’s also flexible enough to cover every scenario I have across my current systems.\n\n----\n\n## Respect My Toolchain 🧰\n\nCopilot’s default instructions list every enabled tool in your workspace, but that list has nothing to do with how I actually expect work to be done. This section exists to define expectations and constraints for execution, not to mirror Copilot’s internal tool inventory.\n\nYou _could_ define this entirely at the repo level—and these rules are intentionally written to allow that—but I’m also spinning up new repos all the time. Having a baseline gives me a predictable starting point and a clear target state. It also ensures that code written against, say, Node v18 doesn’t quietly diverge from a default target of v24.\n\nThese are the tools I use consistently enough to warrant defining globally. Anything else belongs in repo instructions instead.\n\n```md\n## Language-Specific Toolchains\n\n### Python Tooling\n\nApply these rules only in repositories that contain Python code:\n\n- Always use **`uv`**.\n- Never invoke `pip` directly.\n- Assume `uv` for installs, execution, and environment management.\n\n### Node.js Constraints\n\nApply these rules only in repositories that contain Node/JS/TS:\n\n- Target **Node.js ≥ 24**.\n- Target **ESM only**.\n- Do not introduce:\n  - CommonJS patterns\n  - legacy loaders\n  - compatibility shims\n\n### Java Management\n\nApply these rules only in repositories that contain Java or JVM-based builds:\n\n- Use SDKMAN! with a checked-in `.sdkmanrc` for all Java-based repos.\n- If any pinned version is unavailable on the host, bump to the nearest available patch of the same major/minor and update `.sdkmanrc` accordingly.\n- Run Maven/Gradle only via the SDKMAN!-provided binaries—no ambient system Java.\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** These aren’t hard requirements. Think of them as a target state, not an existence check. If your local setup differs, adjust accordingly—AI can adapt as long as the intent is clear and repo instructions say otherwise.\n\n---\n  \n## The Point of All This 🎯\n\nMy instruction setup is designed to make AI behave in the most **predictable, auditable, and useful** way possible—no matter where I’m using it. If you end up writing your own instructions, don’t do it by hand. Use AI to write instructions _for AI_ instead.\n\nAsk for things like `clarity`, `conflict`, `optimize`, or `AI-only consumption`. That framing does a lot of work up front and helps orient the system toward your actual goal instead of guessing.\n\n```md\n- Review this #file:my-global-user.instructions.md for conflict, ambiguity or make targeted edits to optimize. \n- Ask for clarity on intent, whenever needed. \n- Optimize this file for AI consumption and processing without human input. - Output all recommendations for changes that would resolve conflicts or resolve ambiguity.\n- If it's simply clarity, then output in a separate list\n```\n\n> 🦄 Hope you got a couple things out of this whole thing I never actually intended to write. If you end up testing any part of it, I’d love to hear how it behaves for anyone but me!\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Leash, Not Autopilot\n\nThis piece was written with an AI nearby, not in charge—used for reflection, pressure-testing ideas, and occasionally poking holes where confidence got too cozy.

I honestly can’t remember now—Copilot, debugging, something in that ballpark. Doesn’t matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But somehow—like so many of my rabbit holes—it mutated and morphed until I wasn't exactly at the same place I had started. I really can't explain the series of events that happened after that. I blame it on <em>curiosity</em> more than anything, but I did the one thing I swore I'd never do: I asked ChatGPT to do a quick search—pull one of my posts.</p>\n\n<p>And... <strong>nothing</strong>. Like the post didn’t exist. 🕳️</p>\n\n<p>Okay. 😅 Fine. Let’s take a step back. Next, I went straight to Google and typed the same thing. Results were <em>better</em>—sure.

I’m either running wide open or I’m out of order entirely. \n\nIt’s sort of like having railroad tracks running in every direction, all with different trains, different speeds, different destinations, and all of which require fuel that the spark provides—and that spark is not infinite. A lot of people are quick to call the quiet phase burnout, but I disagree. Burnout feels destructive—I’m just **done**.\n\nThe fuel that powered whatever project, hobby, obsession, or mission I was on yesterday simply flickers out. No questions asked, no negotiations, it didn't bother giving me a heads up at all—it just stops. The moment that happens, every single one of those ten automatic lightning-speed trains simultaneously runs out of fuel, and trying to push any one of them manually feels awful. 🫸🚂\n\nYears ago, I actually made a list of all the reasons I was forcing myself through the done-phase, and not one of those reasons mattered to anyone except me. I was trying to be some imaginary version of “normal,” and it was miserable. So, I stopped.\n\nFor the record, “done” isn’t depressed or apathy. I still *want* to finish everything on my list, but the spark—the thing responsible for consistently ignoring clocks and turning multitasking into an Olympic sport—is gone for the moment. “Done” is a reset state filled with calm, drifting, random sleep cycles, and without any pressure or attempts to force myself into motion before the spark returns. 🪫\n\nAnd the spark *always* returns. It never comes back in the same form and I don’t control when it does or which trains it wakes up, but it always comes back. \n\nIn the meantime, boundaries are the first thing to snap into place. I protect my time so that “done” doesn’t collapse into real apathetic burnout. The music gets louder, song loops rotate more frequently, breaks become a sudden requirement, and the drive to be constantly on hibernates naturally. And since I need a certain level of interest and novelty to function, I let the off-schedule naps happen when they need to. And honestly, after a spark cycle has run its course, I probably need those naps anyway. 😴\n\n---\n\n## If You’re in the Pause Too 🌘\n\nSo this post has two purposes: first, I didn’t disappear—I’m still around, just posting less for a while. Second and more important, if you’re going through your own version of this cycle and you’re convinced something is wrong or that you’re stuck or failing—it’s absolutely okay to stop and allow yourself to be off for a bit. 🛌\n\nThe world doesn’t explode when you don’t finish a project and work will survive if you take a mental health day. Remember, the spark always comes back and the trains will start to move on their own again. 🚂✨ \n\nThe direction might shift, it might be a new hobby, a new purpose, or a new goal, but the energy will return when it's good and ready to be on again. It might not look like a version of normal the rest of the world understands, but it doesn’t have to make sense to the rest of the world.\n\nIt only needs to make sense to you. 🫶\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Off-Cycle Notes\n\nChatGPT helped stitch the wording together and composed this footer after not-at-all-calmly redefining the rules *again*. The spark, the stall, and the reboot are all mine.",

I finally took the break I’ve been semi-planning for a while. Honestly, I almost extended it but I don’t much know what to do with myself if I’m not writing something every little bit—so here I am, up <em>way too late</em> (with appetizers, nonetheless). Partly delirious is, clearly, the perfect state for writing this post.

I’m gonna blame GitHub partly, because their last release must have set a record somewhere. I’ve spent days reading notes, testing, circling back, and still finding things I somehow missed the first three passes.  </p>\n\n<p>The bigger piece, though, is that I had an idea (<em>okay—several ideas</em> 🤷‍♀️) and need a little time to see if it can actually work. So nearly all my hours have gone to coding and prompting instead of writing. Can’t be helped—this situation currently demands my attention! Besides, arguing with those voices when they insist never ends well, so it’s faster to just give in from the start.👂🌀 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fakerul8rwa5e94tel1sb.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fakerul8rwa5e94tel1sb.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"github-universe-review\" href=\"#github-universe-review\">\n  </a>\n  GitHub Universe Review 🪐\n</h2>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, one of <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/#h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub’s recent updates</a> claims they’re adding a new user every second—<strong>36 million new developers</strong> this year alone.

Agents, Agents, and More Agents 🦾🎭\n</h2>\n\n<p>If your days are spent inside VS Code, then by far the most impactful change GitHub announced starts with a complete overhaul to chat modes. The obvious shift is that anything formerly known as a <code>chat mode</code> is now an <code>agent</code> in GitHub's universe. VS Code editor UI is catching up quickly, but configuration via repository files works today.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <em>Why, yes!</em> That <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-chat-modes-explained-with-personality-2f4c\">\"chat modes\" mini-series</a> I <strong>quite literally <em>just finished</em></strong> immediately won the \"poorly timed posts requiring instant corrections\" award. 🙄 Honestly, I'm not really surprised—and absolutely worth it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anything that currently lives in a <code>.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md</code> file can be safely relocated to its new home in <strong><code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code></strong>. Besides a few settings, everything else in VS Code should still function the exact same way—but watch for the release notes to drop. The <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official release notes</a> should always be your version of truth.</p>\n\n<p>If you're part of an organization or enterprise, there's a reserved <code>&lt;org-name&gt;/.github</code> repository available where you can drop your agents at <strong><code>./agents/*.agent.md</code></strong>. For the internal version, add your agents in a repo at <strong><code>&lt;org-name&gt;/.github-private/agents/*.agent.md</code></strong> instead.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I haven't tested enterprise yet. I was already impatient with the whole approval process before this rose to a FOMO event! <em>Naturally</em>, I assigned \"urgent\" work to random <em>somewhat adjacent</em> roles (after I stretched) with a shocking level of confidence in this process I was defining as I went.

There’s even mention of a local <code>~/.copilot/agents</code> directory for global use—needs testing, but it’s promising.  </p>\n\n<p>GitHub also slipped in <em>enhanced model selection, image support, and a streamlined UI</em> in the October set of updates, making the CLI feel far more polished.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnc7yuizmmueqlhwacczy.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnc7yuizmmueqlhwacczy.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Screenshot of GitHub CLI with custom agent selection\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1002\" height=\"340\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I'm still not caught up with the new CLI, so you guys are going to have to help me out with the functional half of this one!

I’m gonna blame GitHub partly, because their last release must have set a record somewhere. I’ve spent days reading notes, testing, circling back, and still finding things I somehow missed the first three passes.  </p>\n\n<p>The bigger piece, though, is that I had an idea (<em>okay—several ideas</em> 🤷‍♀️) and need a little time to see if it can actually work. So nearly all my hours have gone to coding and prompting instead of writing. Can’t be helped—this situation currently demands my attention!

Agents, Agents, and More Agents 🦾🎭\n</h2>\n\n<p>If your days are spent inside VS Code, then by far the most impactful change GitHub announced starts with a complete overhaul to chat modes. The obvious shift is that anything formerly known as a <code>chat mode</code> is now an <code>agent</code> in GitHub's universe. VS Code editor UI is catching up quickly, but configuration via repository files works today.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <em>Why, yes!</em> That <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-chat-modes-explained-with-personality-2f4c\">\"chat modes\" mini-series</a> I <strong>quite literally <em>just finished</em></strong> immediately won the \"poorly timed posts requiring instant corrections\" award. 🙄 Honestly, I'm not really surprised—and absolutely worth it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anything that currently lives in a <code>.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md</code> file can be safely relocated to its new home in <strong><code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code></strong>. Besides a few settings, everything else in VS Code should still function the exact same way—but watch for the release notes to drop. The <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official release notes</a> should always be your version of truth.</p>\n\n<p>If you're part of an organization or enterprise, there's a reserved <code>&lt;org-name&gt;/.github</code> repository available where you can drop your agents at <strong><code>./agents/*.agent.md</code></strong>. For the internal version, add your agents in a repo at <strong><code>&lt;org-name&gt;/.github-private/agents/*.agent.md</code></strong> instead.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I haven't tested enterprise yet. I was already impatient with the whole approval process before this rose to a FOMO event! <em>Naturally</em>, I assigned \"urgent\" work to random <em>somewhat adjacent</em> roles (after I stretched) with a shocking level of confidence in this process I was defining as I went.

      "body_markdown": "---\ntitle: Top 10 GitHub Copilot Updates You Actually Need to Know About 💥\npublished: true\ndescription: GitHub Copilot’s wild late-October 2025 release: agents, smarter reviews, embeddings, metrics, and that one “helpful” test that nearly went to prod. Chaotic, hilarious, and absolutely worth the read.\ntags: [githubcopilot, github, ai, news]\ncover_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/08pzuo9k81oa1cku23ys.png?v=2025\n---\n\n## **⚠️ MCP Safety Check (do this before you sleep)**  \n\n- Remove high-risk tools you don’t need (merge/delete/admin).  \n- Scope tokens to least privilege and repo allow-lists.  \n- Add human-in-the-loop on deploy/merge tools (required reviewers or environment approvals).\n- The related dramatics are further down, keep reading! 📖\n\n---\n\n> 🦄 Hey friends! I finally took the break I’ve been semi-planning for a while. Honestly, I almost extended it but I don’t much know what to do with myself if I’m not writing something every little bit—so here I am, up *way too late* (with appetizers, nonetheless). Partly delirious is, clearly, the perfect state for writing this post. You may consider yourself adequately notified (and sufficiently warned) that I make no promises of sense from this point forward! 🥱💤✍️\n>\n> I am also fully aware of the missing half to [the RAI Attribution post](https://dev.to/anchildress1/did-ai-erase-attribution-your-git-history-is-missing-a-co-author-1m2l) that I keep saying I’ll write—and I will, *eventually*. I’m gonna blame GitHub partly, because their last release must have set a record somewhere. I’ve spent days reading notes, testing, circling back, and still finding things I somehow missed the first three passes.  \n>\n> The bigger piece, though, is that I had an idea (*okay—several ideas* 🤷‍♀️) and need a little time to see if it can actually work. So nearly all my hours have gone to coding and prompting instead of writing. Can’t be helped—this situation currently demands my attention! Besides, arguing with those voices when they insist never ends well, so it’s faster to just give in from the start.👂🌀 \n\n![Human-crafted, AI-edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/akerul8rwa5e94tel1sb.png?v=2025)\n\n---\n\n## GitHub Universe Review 🪐\n\nMeanwhile, one of [GitHub’s recent updates](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/#h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth) claims they’re adding a new user every second—**36 million new developers** this year alone. That’s about a 20% jump in everything GitHub, and AI tops the list. Which means Copilot just got a *lot* of upgrades.\n\nThanks to last week’s incredibly full—*read: excessive*—release, I don’t know when I’ll catch up again. So I pulled together the ones that hit me hardest in a semi-ordered manner. Whether that’s good or bad, we’ll see! ⚖️😳  \n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Nobody needs *thirty* feature drops in a single day. 🙄 Go look at the last week of October! *GitHub, what were y’all thinking?* Especially when [GitHub Universe ’25](https://githubuniverse.com/) was happening the same day!  \n\n**\"Brave\" is one word** for it. This particular dev calls it a near-perfect example of \"*glutton for punishment*\"—and it’s moved in next door to \"*Friday deployments*\". Honestly, you guys deserve a medal for sheer nerve, lots of luck, and probable animal sacrifice required to pull that one off successfully. 🥇👏🙇‍♀️\n\n---\n\n## 1. Agents, Agents, and More Agents 🦾🎭\n\nIf your days are spent inside VS Code, then by far the most impactful change GitHub announced starts with a complete overhaul to chat modes. The obvious shift is that anything formerly known as a `chat mode` is now an `agent` in GitHub's universe. VS Code editor UI is catching up quickly, but configuration via repository files works today.\n\n> 🦄 *Why, yes!* That [\"chat modes\" mini-series](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-chat-modes-explained-with-personality-2f4c) I **quite literally _just finished_** immediately won the \"poorly timed posts requiring instant corrections\" award. 🙄 Honestly, I'm not really surprised—and absolutely worth it.\n\nAnything that currently lives in a `.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md` file can be safely relocated to its new home in **`.github/agents/*.agent.md`**. Besides a few settings, everything else in VS Code should still function the exact same way—but watch for the release notes to drop. The [official release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_105) should always be your version of truth.\n\nIf you're part of an organization or enterprise, there's a reserved `<org-name>/.github` repository available where you can drop your agents at **`./agents/*.agent.md`**. For the internal version, add your agents in a repo at **`<org-name>/.github-private/agents/*.agent.md`** instead.\n\n> 🦄 I haven't tested enterprise yet. I was already impatient with the whole approval process before this rose to a FOMO event! *Naturally*, I assigned \"urgent\" work to random *somewhat adjacent* roles (after I stretched) with a shocking level of confidence in this process I was defining as I went. Spoiler—I'm still waiting! ⏳😅\n\n---\n\n## 2. Agents Dashboard 🧭\n\nOnce you catch up on the rename, your favorite sparkly personalities are now fully compatible with Copilot coding agent. They live in the new **Agents panel**:\n\n![Screenshot new GitHub Copilot Agents Panel with custom agent options](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9fxceoq0tt3dazyy0w1o.png?v=2025)\n\nYou’ll also see an **Agents tab** that lets you steer Copilot’s coding agent mid-workflow—without killing your current run. Every send still costs a premium request, so use wisely!\n\n![Screenshot of GitHub Copilot coding agent new tab view](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ceauyv4xj8v924qotbqh.png?v=2025)\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Markdown directives didn’t change much, but configuration did. Check the [custom-agent docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration) for more info. \n\n---\n\n## 3. For the CLI Folks 🖥️\n\nThe new Copilot CLI is *legit*. Custom agents now extend to the [latest CLI docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#use-custom-agents), which I haven't tested nearly as much as I'd like. Once you get the agent shared with either your repo or org, then use the `/agent` command or `--agent=<name>` flag. There’s even mention of a local `~/.copilot/agents` directory for global use—needs testing, but it’s promising.  \n\nGitHub also slipped in *enhanced model selection, image support, and a streamlined UI* in the October set of updates, making the CLI feel far more polished.\n\n![Screenshot of GitHub CLI with custom agent selection](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nc7yuizmmueqlhwacczy.png?v=2025)\n\n> 🦄 I'm still not caught up with the new CLI, so you guys are going to have to help me out with the functional half of this one! So go test it out and then come tell me everything I'm missing out on!\n\n---\n\n## 4. Coding agent reaches further ✨\n\nCopilot coding agent can now work on any open pull request—not just the one it created. Use the same `@copilot` mention you’d use on a Copilot PR, watch the little eyes 👀 pop up, and let coding agent get to work. \n\nIt also works through Slack (assuming your Slack permissions actually line up) and through the new Copilot CLI. I would be much more excited about this development if work and GitHub weren’t in a stalemate over one permission that blocks access entirely. 🙁\n\n> 🦄 I do have a plan for the Slack issue… *sort of.* Something must be done about this disservice to the Slack population! Until then, the receipts are here: [coding agent in any PR](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-ask-copilot-coding-agent-to-make-changes-in-any-pull-request-with-copilot/) and [coding agent in Slack](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-work-with-copilot-coding-agent-in-slack). ✨\n\n---\n\n## 5. Smarter Copilot Code Reviews 🧾\n\nI've always loved [Copilot's code reviews](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-new-public-preview-features-in-copilot-code-review-ai-reviews-that-see-the-full-picture)! It was a game changer when Copilot was able to pull instructions automatically from any repo. This latest change is just as impressive—now your CodeQL and ESLint integrations can be checked automatically whenever Copilot performs a review. There's rumor about more linters on the way, soon! \n\nOne of my current favorite features includes these handy little notifications that pop up any time a linter error occurs in the most recent build. If you're not seeing them yet, you might need the preview feature enabled. Follow instructions in [this previous post](https://dev.to/anchildress1/magical-coding-agent-the-ship-ready-spellbook-2mbf#firstenable-the-cool-stuff). 😇 \n\n![Screenshot GitHub ESLint warning in PR](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jzyhrsvljmvuz95n7orc.png?v=2025)\n\n> 🦄 When someone at work asked me why my PR was littered with lint warnings, my immediate response was, \"*I know—isn't it great!* 😁\" Then I had to explain the divergent thought process that I completely failed to recognize through my initial excitement. \n> \n> I did get around to it, eventually: _\"It's only great because these highlight the existing issues that would have been handled had I been aware of their existence. **And** I've just made it nearly impossible for any more to sneak in without notice!\"_ Feel free to inject all the fervor you'd expect from a 7-year-old after a full bag of skittles for maximum immersive effect. 🫣\n\n---\n\n## 6. New Embeddings = Smarter Copilot 🧠\n\nThis is the quiet one of the group, but seriously impressive nonetheless! This quiet update is huge—embeddings now drive faster, more accurate code retrieval for Copilot. **GitHub’s Sept 2025 update reports +110%/+113% acceptance for C#/Java in VS Code, with ~37.6% retrieval gains.** Most people won’t even notice—they’ll just feel Copilot getting *smarter*.  \n\nConsidering almost all of my Java friends are still IntelliJ Enthusiasts, despite my persistence of missing out. And who knows what my C# friends are up to—mostly hiding, I think! 🤔 \n\n> 🦄 Here's the [GitHub Metrics](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/copilot-new-embedding-model-vs-code/) if you love benchmarks. Worth a quick read, for sure!\n\n---\n\n## 7. Roster Rotation Changes the Lineup 🎭\n\n**Quick reality check:** model lineups shift fast. Treat anything labeled preview or legacy as volatile and pin versions until you’ve verified replacements behave the same.\n\nGitHub is really pushing the newest versions, which I'm 100% on board with—except for one *tiny-ish-not-really* complaint. 🤏 *What in the world are we supposed to use instead of the o-series models?* I've seen the suggestion, which, as of this week, is drop in GPT-5 as the go-to replacement.\n\n*Seriously*? Surely somebody thought through it more than that! I, no doubt, would have started a fresh debate with myself for making that utterly ridiculous suggestion! 😑\n\nI'm not saying GPT-5 can't handle the job—it *probably* does fine after some solid instructions and guardrails are set up—but it's not the replacement data magician that the ***now-entirely-unsupported* o-series** mastered. *Not even a little close!* \n\n> 🦄 Honestly, I could get behind Gemini 2.5 Pro before GPT-5 on this one. For the very small-scoped runs, GPT-5-mini does top the freebie list. I guess we'll just have to see how this goes!\n\nOther notable retirees include everyone on team Anthropic < v4, including Opus and Sonnet Thinking. Granted Claude 3.5 has a *tiny* bit of life left still, but cake and cards are scheduled to be delivered tomorrow for the goodbye party—November 6, 2025.\n\n> 🦄 For the record, if anyone asks me about the grander playing field of all Copilot models that we got in return? I've got very few complaints overall. I'm not going to be happy about it until I see a realistic replacement for my data magician, though. 😒 Get your latest model news from [the GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models).\n\n---\n\n## 8. GitHub Spark 🔥\n\nSpark is still limited to enterprise users plus a lucky few from the waiting list. You should consider this a special agentic \"Bob the Builder\" that's designed to output a very specific full-stack system: React + TypeScript + Cosmos DB + Azure deploys. I've yet to see anything impressive resembling a backend—but it's entirely possible I gave up before it had a chance.\n\n**Spark is not Copilot**—if you try to ask it a question or if your prompt looks like a conversation, then you'll pay **4 premium requests** for crickets (at best). 🦗 \n\nYou can open the Spark app in a codespace with Copilot (or so it says on [this docs page](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/spark#develop-your-spark-with-copilot)). The two very independent systems are supposed to sync automatically, which is like two siblings arguing over whose turn it is to play with the new friend in town, if you ask me! But at least it's functional chaos. 👯\n\n> 🦄 I'm not even gonna pretend to feel guilty about getting early Spark access. 😆 As far as I'm concerned—between GitHub and work (it's mostly a toss-up)—I deserved that access long before I realized I already had it.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Agentic Workflows via GitHub Next ⚙️\n\nNatural-language GitHub Actions Agentic Workflows got a short spotlight at Universe. Write a YAML-ish markdown file, run `gh aw add ...`, and it becomes a new workflow. I’m still testing the scalability and reuse story.  \n\nI’m not sure yet what this does that coding agent + CLI can’t, but I plan to find out. They have several examples, but the [\"Regular Documentation Update\"](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/update-docs.md) workflow stands out—because if there’s a *non-regular* one, I have questions!\n\n> 🦄 Seriously, if my next “*brilliant*” idea shows up in GitHub’s release notes before I can even investigate the theory, I’m filing an official complaint for telepathic violation. 🧠💥📨  \n\n---\n\n## 10. Not Nearly Everything 🔍\n\nThere’s plenty I left out on purpose: quiet CLI refinements, the auto-model picker (based on *availability*), smarter branch/PR optimizations, and Copilot Spaces with **increased size and repo limits**—which is starting to look like GitHub positioning them to replace enterprise knowledge bases (that would be a good call!) 🧐\n\nThen there’s the quietly rolled-out **enhanced metrics reporting** via the [new billing API updates](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-11-03-manage-budgets-and-track-usage-with-new-billing-api-updates/). Teams can finally *see* their usage—numbers, budgets, and who’s burning through premium requests fastest. Transparency: gift or curse? Guess we'll know who's winning the Premium Request Usage Leaderboard when stats drop at the end of the month.\n\n> 🙋‍♀️ Um… me. The answer is *definitely* me!\n\n---\n\n## Friendly PSA for the GitHub MCP ‼️\n\nThe **GitHub MCP server also got a major boost** with the latest updates, including multi-tool definitions and enhanced defaults for Copilot. Very cool, until Copilot decided to be extra \"*helpful*\".\n\n- My first clue something was off: my name alerting on a merged PR that wasn’t mine. 😲\n- Second: I definitely didn’t click merge! 🤨\n- Then the **prod deploy** pipeline started humming happily, but nothing is approved. 😱\n- Panic queues while Copilot joyously generates release notes for the occasion. 😡\n- Don't worry—everything was fine. I stopped the catastrophe and was able to restore to an equivalent state. 😅\n\nAs soon as I recovered, I pulled all the tools from the official GitHub MCP and **it could have been *much, much worse*!** Like \"DROP REPO\" kinds of *\"worse\"*! Can you imagine how very bad that sort of day would be? Nope—I don't want to either!\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** If you’re using GitHub’s MCP (especially if you're admin anywhere), stop and review which tools are enabled by default. Trust me. You do *not* want to learn what happens following an “accidental DROP REPO” command. 😵\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Written by a human with a mild espresso addiction  \n\nFueled by caffeine, late-night release notes, and questionable curiosity.

So far, it looks like only the name and file path have changed—now located at <code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code>. So, if you're wondering what the differences are between a \"chat mode\" and an \"agent\"—<em>they are the same</em>. It’s probably just the first step, though; there’s clearly more in motion behind the scenes!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I debated even writing this post today.

Chat modes will work in VS Code and Visual Studio (and a few sneak into Coding Agent—check out my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/everything-i-know-about-github-copilot-instructions-from-zero-to-onboarded-for-real-4nb0#how-to-run-it\">custom instructions post for those steps</a>). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🏆 Visual Studio’s catching up with chat modes, but VS Code still runs point on everything Copilot does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insiders</a> with auto-updates turned on (<em>trust</em>—without those updates, Copilot will break without warning). Keep regular VS Code around if you like safety nets—but mine’s a functional dust collector. Updates land overnight if you’re in the US, and any bugs that might have popped up are usually gone by morning. Even on the days I'm still coding when updates drop, it's rarely an issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If VS Code is the Copilot frontier, Insiders is the scout sprinting ahead to check for traps.</strong> Other IDEs follow eventually, but by the time they arrive, you’ll already be home from the exploration with an award and snacks.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🫘 <strong>For the Java devs:</strong> if you’re thinking about switching from JetBrains—nothing beats IntelliJ’s built-in Java environments. Managing your own setup in VS Code can be a pain (start with <a href=\"https://sdkman.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sdkman</a>).

The much safer option is to use <code>#chat-mode-name</code> explicitly in VS Code. Then there’s zero logic the LLM needs to consider before deciding whether to look at the mode you already selected in the dropdown.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>As a theoretical aside</strong>, this is the reality of the AI landscape we’re working with. While the potential is incredible and new advancements emerge almost daily, this is a model that was first previewed in August 2025 (less than two months ago) and <strong>we still need explicit references to manually manage context</strong> for reliable output.

When I tested mine, I opened <strong>Copilot’s debug view</strong> to confirm what was happening behind the scenes. It shows your entire chat mode (minus the frontmatter) being passed to Copilot as part of the <strong>system instructions</strong>, labeled “additional instructions from the user.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxdjskvddgnfqy1vudns4.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxdjskvddgnfqy1vudns4.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Screenshot of VS Code debug view attaching a chat mode as system-level custom instructions\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1003\" height=\"327\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Typically, this is when Copilot decides to show off its own creative interpretation of things I never asked for.

If there’s already solid documentation for the repo, though, it skips all the questions entirely and presents results like it deserves a reward.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> At this point, your best bet is to go full stop.

So far, it looks like only the name and file path have changed—now located at <code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code>. So, if you're wondering what the differences are between a \"chat mode\" and an \"agent\"—<em>they are the same</em>. It’s probably just the first step, though; there’s clearly more in motion behind the scenes!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I debated even writing this post today. I procrastinated until the last possible minute, worked far longer than planned, and then Copilot decided to thoroughly test my patience. Maybe GitHub flipped another switch, maybe it’s just me—but Copilot and I are currently on non-speaking terms. 😒</p>\n\n<p>The upside? It hasn’t reported me to HR yet, so that’s a win. It’s also started throwing shade, which is new, and honestly kind of impressive. I didn’t think it was <em>allowed</em> to do that! 🤭😆  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Quick recap: last week I broke down how I think through creating a custom Copilot chat mode. Somehow that post landed in the <a href=\"https://dev.to/devteam/top-7-featured-dev-posts-of-the-week-cen\">Top 7</a>—no idea how exactly, but I’m grateful for it!

Keep regular VS Code around if you like safety nets—but mine’s a functional dust collector. Updates land overnight if you’re in the US, and any bugs that might have popped up are usually gone by morning. Even on the days I'm still coding when updates drop, it's rarely an issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If VS Code is the Copilot frontier, Insiders is the scout sprinting ahead to check for traps.</strong> Other IDEs follow eventually, but by the time they arrive, you’ll already be home from the exploration with an award and snacks.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🫘 <strong>For the Java devs:</strong> if you’re thinking about switching from JetBrains—nothing beats IntelliJ’s built-in Java environments.

Here’s how to set up, test, and share custom modes like a professional who occasionally yells at their AI.\ntags: [githubcopilot, ai, tutorial, productivity]\nseries: Everything I Can Explain About GitHub Copilot C̴h̴a̴t̴ ̴M̴o̴d̴e̴s̴ Agents\ncover_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8i2k45vj5cxf3rawbq49.jpg?v=2025\npublished_at: 2025-10-08 07:18 -0500\n---\n\n## 📰 Updated 2025-11-01\n\nRight on cue with GitHub’s infamously rapid-fire [Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-custom-agents-for-github-copilot), the chat modes have officially been renamed to agents. So far, it looks like only the name and file path have changed—now located at `.github/agents/*.agent.md`. So, if you're wondering what the differences are between a \"chat mode\" and an \"agent\"—*they are the same*. It’s probably just the first step, though; there’s clearly more in motion behind the scenes!\n\n---\n\n> 🦄 I debated even writing this post today. I procrastinated until the last possible minute, worked far longer than planned, and then Copilot decided to thoroughly test my patience. Maybe GitHub flipped another switch, maybe it’s just me—but Copilot and I are currently on non-speaking terms. 😒\n>\n> The upside? It hasn’t reported me to HR yet, so that’s a win. It’s also started throwing shade, which is new, and honestly kind of impressive. I didn’t think it was *allowed* to do that! 🤭😆  \n\nQuick recap: last week I broke down how I think through creating a custom Copilot chat mode. Somehow that post landed in the [Top 7](https://dev.to/devteam/top-7-featured-dev-posts-of-the-week-cen)—no idea how exactly, but I’m grateful for it! Huge thanks to everyone who read, shared, or dropped a comment. 🙏 \n\nAnd, as promised: now that you’ve built a custom chat mode for yourself, let’s talk about how to use, test, and share it.\n\n![Human-Crafted, AI-Edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xsfq5q09y5oya6eq6tjq.png)\n\n---\n\n## Set Up VS Code 🧭  \n\nRemember when I warned you to install VS Code Insiders ahead of time? That wasn’t just for show. Chat modes will work in VS Code and Visual Studio (and a few sneak into Coding Agent—check out my [custom instructions post for those steps](https://dev.to/anchildress1/everything-i-know-about-github-copilot-instructions-from-zero-to-onboarded-for-real-4nb0#how-to-run-it)). \n\n> 🏆 Visual Studio’s catching up with chat modes, but VS Code still runs point on everything Copilot does.\n\nInstall [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) with auto-updates turned on (*trust*—without those updates, Copilot will break without warning). Keep regular VS Code around if you like safety nets—but mine’s a functional dust collector. Updates land overnight if you’re in the US, and any bugs that might have popped up are usually gone by morning. Even on the days I'm still coding when updates drop, it's rarely an issue.\n\n**If VS Code is the Copilot frontier, Insiders is the scout sprinting ahead to check for traps.** Other IDEs follow eventually, but by the time they arrive, you’ll already be home from the exploration with an award and snacks.\n\n> 🫘 **For the Java devs:** if you’re thinking about switching from JetBrains—nothing beats IntelliJ’s built-in Java environments. Managing your own setup in VS Code can be a pain (start with [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/)). Still, *it’s absolutely worth it* if Copilot’s even a semi-regular part of your workflow.\n\n---\n\n## Create New Chat Modes ⚙️  \n\nVS Code currently includes an experimental setting called `chat.modeFilesLocations`. *Experimental* means it can (and probably will) change at any time without notice. For now, you can use this to specify directories where VS Code should look for custom chat mode files. Any chat modes existing inside a directory listed here will automatically show up as an option in the chat mode dropdown. \n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** I always include the local `.github/chatmodes` folder so everything repo-specific stays within easy reach.\n\n![VS Code settings showing chat.modeFilesLocations options](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o2r84cko1s5ce11395c5.png?v=2025)\n\nIn VS Code, you can create a chat mode either for a specific repo or globally for your user. Click the mode dropdown in the chat window and choose `Configure Modes...`, or open the Command Palette and run `Chat: Configure Chat Modes...`. You’ll also find it under `Modes` in the chat configuration panel.\n\n![VS Code Configure Chat Modes dialog open in chat panel](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t9yqbjmj3435vfw2ialr.png?v=2025)\n\nFrom there, you can edit an existing mode or create a new one. If you’re adding something brand new, type a filename without an extension and it’ll generate a “starter file” for you (though calling it that is generous at best!)\n\n> 🦄 I’m still not convinced `.github/chatmodes` really matters anymore. That’s just where chat modes lived originally, and old habits are stubborn. If I don't store them in a global location, then mine stay there because, honestly, it feels wrong to put them anywhere else.\n\n---\n\n## In Case You Missed It 👀\n\nHere's the first post that explains everything you need to know about creating your own custom chat modes for Copilot.\n\n{% embed https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-chat-modes-explained-with-personality-2f4c %}\n\n---\n\n## **UPDATE** 💥\n\n> I just learned something new literally three seconds ago and had to update this post before I dive into this new rabbit hole. 🤣 \n\nI'm working through the testing phase of a couple of chat modes currently and somehow ended up with a very weird context glitch in GPT-5-mini that makes zero sense.\n\nFirst, I have said chat mode selected in the dropdown, and my prompt is intentionally vague—it asks Copilot to identify ambiguity and conflict between my instructions and its system instructions.\n\nThis is what I got back:\n\n```plaintext\nIf the chat mode wasn’t invoked by name or didn’t include a machine-visible trigger in the current message, it wasn’t promoted to the working instruction set.\n``` \n\nApparently, just referencing desired output while the chat mode’s selected isn’t enough of a hint for my little friend here.

The much safer option is to use `#chat-mode-name` explicitly in VS Code.

While the potential is incredible and new advancements emerge almost daily, this is a model that was first previewed in August 2025 (less than two months ago) and **we still need explicit references to manually manage context** for reliable output. You can’t assume reliability or even consistency in anything AI does—*yet*.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Your Custom Chat Mode 🧪  \n\nOnce you’ve saved your file, you can select your new mode from the dropdown in the Copilot chat window. When I tested mine, I opened **Copilot’s debug view** to confirm what was happening behind the scenes. It shows your entire chat mode (minus the frontmatter) being passed to Copilot as part of the **system instructions**, labeled “additional instructions from the user.”\n\n![Screenshot of VS Code debug view attaching a chat mode as system-level custom instructions](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xdjskvddgnfqy1vudns4.png?v=2025)\n\nTypically, this is when Copilot decides to show off its own creative interpretation of things I never asked for. Let’s use my [Instructionalist mode](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/docs/chatmodes/instructionalist.md) as an example. \n\nIt’s supposed to act like a conversation partner—asking targeted questions to uncover missing or unclear details in my repo documentation.

Priorities have now changed to fixing the instructions that failed to begin with. We’ll get back to using the chat mode after it's safely back on the road.\n\n![Screenshot of VS Code Copilot Chat response after initial ask regarding its process](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6x8sjcayv5m6dxs2d2lp.png)\n\nIf you notice here, Copilot does the typical “oh my! you’re absolutely right!

Drop the niceties and state your expectations clearly. If the response doesn’t meet those expectations, **ask why not**. Prompt Copilot to fix itself, and focus on small, deliberate improvements instead of rewriting from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## Share Your Chat Mode 📤  \n\nWithin smaller teams, you can store chat modes in a shared repo within a `.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md` file.

So far, it looks like only the name and file path have changed—now located at <code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code>. So, if you're wondering what the differences are between a \"chat mode\" and an \"agent\"—<em>they are the same</em>. It’s probably just the first step, though; there’s clearly more in motion behind the scenes!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I’ve been writing these weekly Copilot posts since June and it’s been great… but (of course there has to be a “but”) I feel like I've hit a wall on topics. Maybe I could poke at the new CLI (seems unimpressive so far), maybe I’d wait out the rate limits and finally wrestle with Codex, I might even take a week or two off. Then someone asked a new question and I realized—nope. None of that is happening, at least not yet.  </p>\n\n<p>I’ve covered pretty much every major Copilot angle except this one: chat modes. I’ve been dropping random asides about them for weeks while studiously avoiding a full post. Well, I guess time’s up. Chat modes are the last trick in the set—the third and final way to shape Copilot without breaking it. At least, <em>I’m gonna try</em> to explain my thought process in a way that makes sense to someone who isn’t already living inside my head.</p>\n\n<p>And while we’re here, current me is once again making promises that future me will probably regret—next week I’ll show you how to put your shiny new chat mode to work. Spoiler: you’ll want VS Code (or Insiders) installed before then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fqzzhmrykwxgzn1ew0nux.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fqzzhmrykwxgzn1ew0nux.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Human-Crafted, AI-Edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-are-chat-modes\" href=\"#what-are-chat-modes\">\n  </a>\n  What are Chat Modes? 🤔\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can thank my friends at work for asking me this question directly, or I might’ve successfully dodged this post entirely. I don’t think I even answered in the moment—I spun into a whirlwind of deep thought and then sprinted back to whatever I was <em>supposed</em> to be doing after some undetermined amount of time I spent over-thinking Copilot. 😆</p>\n\n<p>I’ve thought about writing this up several times, but after a couple of false starts I started actively avoiding it. One—it’s highly specific. Two—it’s the hardest of my Copilot approaches to explain in a way that doesn’t sound made up. Which… is fair, because I did make a lot of it up for my own workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Before we dig into my thought process, let’s take inventory of the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/response-customization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“official” GitHub story</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8p7xi0p6urphzqsb7qi.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8p7xi0p6urphzqsb7qi.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Screenshot GitHub docs regarding Copilot customization\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1558\" height=\"618\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Conveniently, GitHub doesn’t mention <strong>chat modes</strong> at all (at least not anywhere I could find). <em>Why?</em> No clue! They do exist, though, and they’re a visible part of GitHub’s own <a href=\"https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-copilot</a> repo. After some digging, I landed on <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VS Code’s explanation</a>—which at least proves they’re real:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1l3nua5lu12h6g69ufup.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1l3nua5lu12h6g69ufup.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Screenshot VS Code docs regarding Copilot customization\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"298\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"how-i-explain-it-instead\" href=\"#how-i-explain-it-instead\">\n  </a>\n  How I Explain It, Instead 🎭\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are three unique ways to shape how Copilot behaves, and I’ve already written whole series on the first two:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Instructions</strong> — These are your foundation. They ground Copilot in a methodology or approach, almost like a README for AI that explains <strong>how to behave</strong>. If you want to see the full breakdown, check out my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/everything-i-know-about-github-copilot-instructions-from-zero-to-onboarded-for-real-4nb0\">Everything I Know About GitHub Copilot Instructions</a> series.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reusable prompts</strong> — These are your recipes, a full printout of <strong>step-by-step directions</strong> that break a complex task into smaller manageable pieces. They’re the “do these parts in this order to reach a specific goal” instructions I covered in my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">Everything You Wanted to Know About Reusable (and Experimental) Prompts</a> series.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Chat modes</strong> — These are your characters. It’s <strong>the agent’s state of being</strong>, and it can combine both instructions and reusable prompts into a larger directive. Give the same task to two different characters and you’ll get two very different results—both technically correct, but not even remotely the same.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Nobody expects House to solve a problem like Daenerys Targaryen. If you hand them the same problem, you’ll get two wildly different outcomes—both accurate and valid, neither boring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"build-from-scratch\" href=\"#build-from-scratch\">\n  </a>\n  Build From Scratch 🛠️\n</h2>\n\n<p>I mostly follow my <strong>PRIOR</strong> model for these, the exact same one I use for all prompts in general. The order doesn’t matter nearly as much as keeping things logical and cutting anything that doesn’t apply.</p>\n\n<p>Also, don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying order <em>never</em> matters—because sometimes it absolutely does. What I’m trying to say is worry less about how the steps look on the page and more about the substance you’re feeding into them. As long as it makes sense to you, then it will most likely make sense to Copilot, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 You can paint like Picasso or carve like Michelangelo—both masterpieces, completely different processes. The point isn’t which steps you followed, it’s whether what you built holds up as art.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"frontmatter\" href=\"#frontmatter\">\n  </a>\n  Frontmatter 🔖\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remember that a chat mode is essentially a character sheet for Copilot to use every time it completes a task with that costume on. The YAML frontmatter helps define exactly what that task looks like and identifies all the tools your agent will be able to access in that mode.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">description</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"pi\">|</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">Automates secure, structured, and centralized logging implementation and reviews across your codebase, wielding JSON like a switchblade and enforcing structured readability like a made man.</span>\n<span class=\"na\">model</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">claude-sonnet-4</span>\n<span class=\"na\">tools</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">search</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">editFiles</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">readFiles</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">runInTerminal</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">runTests</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">findTestFiles</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> If you leave the <code>model</code> definition out of the frontmatter, then the model selected in the user's dropdown will be the default selection.

Want a sleek vampire voice or iZombie-style debugging? Go for it! Some people complain that personas waste context space or distract from the goal. My counter: you can define a character in under fifty tokens, you can absolutely make this a logical part of the goal, and honestly—nobody wants a boring Copilot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Well, I don’t want a boring Copilot! Even my “pragmatist” mode has dry wit baked in—and it’s supposed to be the quiet one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A persona should define everything about a character, including moods, style, and a reason to exist. If you only tell it how to respond then you’ll end up with a simple tone. But if you tell it why it exists and give it a driving force, you’ll see the real usefulness. Tone becomes a quick addition to steer the dialog.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪄 Voila!

So far, it looks like only the name and file path have changed—now located at <code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code>. So, if you're wondering what the differences are between a \"chat mode\" and an \"agent\"—<em>they are the same</em>. It’s probably just the first step, though; there’s clearly more in motion behind the scenes!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I’ve been writing these weekly Copilot posts since June and it’s been great… but (of course there has to be a “but”) I feel like I've hit a wall on topics. Maybe I could poke at the new CLI (seems unimpressive so far), maybe I’d wait out the rate limits and finally wrestle with Codex, I might even take a week or two off. Then someone asked a new question and I realized—nope. None of that is happening, at least not yet.  </p>\n\n<p>I’ve covered pretty much every major Copilot angle except this one: chat modes. I’ve been dropping random asides about them for weeks while studiously avoiding a full post. Well, I guess time’s up. Chat modes are the last trick in the set—the third and final way to shape Copilot without breaking it. At least, <em>I’m gonna try</em> to explain my thought process in a way that makes sense to someone who isn’t already living inside my head.</p>\n\n<p>And while we’re here, current me is once again making promises that future me will probably regret—next week I’ll show you how to put your shiny new chat mode to work. Spoiler: you’ll want VS Code (or Insiders) installed before then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fqzzhmrykwxgzn1ew0nux.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fqzzhmrykwxgzn1ew0nux.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Human-Crafted, AI-Edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-are-chat-modes\" href=\"#what-are-chat-modes\">\n  </a>\n  What are Chat Modes? 🤔\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can thank my friends at work for asking me this question directly, or I might’ve successfully dodged this post entirely. I don’t think I even answered in the moment—I spun into a whirlwind of deep thought and then sprinted back to whatever I was <em>supposed</em> to be doing after some undetermined amount of time I spent over-thinking Copilot. 😆</p>\n\n<p>I’ve thought about writing this up several times, but after a couple of false starts I started actively avoiding it. One—it’s highly specific. Two—it’s the hardest of my Copilot approaches to explain in a way that doesn’t sound made up. Which… is fair, because I did make a lot of it up for my own workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Before we dig into my thought process, let’s take inventory of the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/response-customization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“official” GitHub story</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8p7xi0p6urphzqsb7qi.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe8p7xi0p6urphzqsb7qi.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Screenshot GitHub docs regarding Copilot customization\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1558\" height=\"618\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Conveniently, GitHub doesn’t mention <strong>chat modes</strong> at all (at least not anywhere I could find). <em>Why?</em> No clue! They do exist, though, and they’re a visible part of GitHub’s own <a href=\"https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-copilot</a> repo. After some digging, I landed on <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VS Code’s explanation</a>—which at least proves they’re real:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1l3nua5lu12h6g69ufup.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1l3nua5lu12h6g69ufup.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Screenshot VS Code docs regarding Copilot customization\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"298\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"how-i-explain-it-instead\" href=\"#how-i-explain-it-instead\">\n  </a>\n  How I Explain It, Instead 🎭\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are three unique ways to shape how Copilot behaves, and I’ve already written whole series on the first two:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Instructions</strong> — These are your foundation. They ground Copilot in a methodology or approach, almost like a README for AI that explains <strong>how to behave</strong>. If you want to see the full breakdown, check out my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/everything-i-know-about-github-copilot-instructions-from-zero-to-onboarded-for-real-4nb0\">Everything I Know About GitHub Copilot Instructions</a> series.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reusable prompts</strong> — These are your recipes, a full printout of <strong>step-by-step directions</strong> that break a complex task into smaller manageable pieces. They’re the “do these parts in this order to reach a specific goal” instructions I covered in my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">Everything You Wanted to Know About Reusable (and Experimental) Prompts</a> series.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Chat modes</strong> — These are your characters. It’s <strong>the agent’s state of being</strong>, and it can combine both instructions and reusable prompts into a larger directive. Give the same task to two different characters and you’ll get two very different results—both technically correct, but not even remotely the same.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Nobody expects House to solve a problem like Daenerys Targaryen. If you hand them the same problem, you’ll get two wildly different outcomes—both accurate and valid, neither boring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"build-from-scratch\" href=\"#build-from-scratch\">\n  </a>\n  Build From Scratch 🛠️\n</h2>\n\n<p>I mostly follow my <strong>PRIOR</strong> model for these, the exact same one I use for all prompts in general. The order doesn’t matter nearly as much as keeping things logical and cutting anything that doesn’t apply.</p>\n\n<p>Also, don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying order <em>never</em> matters—because sometimes it absolutely does. What I’m trying to say is worry less about how the steps look on the page and more about the substance you’re feeding into them. As long as it makes sense to you, then it will most likely make sense to Copilot, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 You can paint like Picasso or carve like Michelangelo—both masterpieces, completely different processes. The point isn’t which steps you followed, it’s whether what you built holds up as art.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"frontmatter\" href=\"#frontmatter\">\n  </a>\n  Frontmatter 🔖\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remember that a chat mode is essentially a character sheet for Copilot to use every time it completes a task with that costume on. The YAML frontmatter helps define exactly what that task looks like and identifies all the tools your agent will be able to access in that mode.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">description</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"pi\">|</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">Automates secure, structured, and centralized logging implementation and reviews across your codebase, wielding JSON like a switchblade and enforcing structured readability like a made man.</span>\n<span class=\"na\">model</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">claude-sonnet-4</span>\n<span class=\"na\">tools</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">search</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">editFiles</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">readFiles</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">runInTerminal</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">runTests</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">findTestFiles</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> If you leave the <code>model</code> definition out of the frontmatter, then the model selected in the user's dropdown will be the default selection.

Want a sleek vampire voice or iZombie-style debugging? Go for it! Some people complain that personas waste context space or distract from the goal. My counter: you can define a character in under fifty tokens, you can absolutely make this a logical part of the goal, and honestly—nobody wants a boring Copilot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Well, I don’t want a boring Copilot! Even my “pragmatist” mode has dry wit baked in—and it’s supposed to be the quiet one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A persona should define everything about a character, including moods, style, and a reason to exist. If you only tell it how to respond then you’ll end up with a simple tone. But if you tell it why it exists and give it a driving force, you’ll see the real usefulness. Tone becomes a quick addition to steer the dialog.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪄 Voila!

Now officially documented and live in your repo, they let you define Copilot’s behavior with your own personality, tone, and workflow—because coding assistants should sound like you.\ntags: [githubcopilot, ai, tutorial, productivity]\nseries: Everything I Can Explain About GitHub Copilot C̴h̴a̴t̴ ̴M̴o̴d̴e̴s̴ Agents\ncover_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p3gj357ptihfl2b6711l.png?v=2025\npublished_at: 2025-10-01 09:11 -0500\n---\n\n## 📰 Updated 2025-11-01\n\nRight on cue with GitHub’s infamously rapid-fire [Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-custom-agents-for-github-copilot), the chat modes have officially been renamed to agents. So far, it looks like only the name and file path have changed—now located at `.github/agents/*.agent.md`. So, if you're wondering what the differences are between a \"chat mode\" and an \"agent\"—*they are the same*. It’s probably just the first step, though; there’s clearly more in motion behind the scenes!\n\n---\n\n> 🦄 I’ve been writing these weekly Copilot posts since June and it’s been great… but (of course there has to be a “but”) I feel like I've hit a wall on topics. Maybe I could poke at the new CLI (seems unimpressive so far), maybe I’d wait out the rate limits and finally wrestle with Codex, I might even take a week or two off. Then someone asked a new question and I realized—nope. None of that is happening, at least not yet.  \n\n> I’ve covered pretty much every major Copilot angle except this one: chat modes. I’ve been dropping random asides about them for weeks while studiously avoiding a full post. Well, I guess time’s up. Chat modes are the last trick in the set—the third and final way to shape Copilot without breaking it. At least, *I’m gonna try* to explain my thought process in a way that makes sense to someone who isn’t already living inside my head.\n\n> And while we’re here, current me is once again making promises that future me will probably regret—next week I’ll show you how to put your shiny new chat mode to work. Spoiler: you’ll want VS Code (or Insiders) installed before then.\n\n![Human-Crafted, AI-Edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qzzhmrykwxgzn1ew0nux.png?v=2025)\n\n---\n\n## What are Chat Modes? 🤔\n\nYou can thank my friends at work for asking me this question directly, or I might’ve successfully dodged this post entirely. I don’t think I even answered in the moment—I spun into a whirlwind of deep thought and then sprinted back to whatever I was *supposed* to be doing after some undetermined amount of time I spent over-thinking Copilot. 😆\n\nI’ve thought about writing this up several times, but after a couple of false starts I started actively avoiding it. One—it’s highly specific. Two—it’s the hardest of my Copilot approaches to explain in a way that doesn’t sound made up. Which… is fair, because I did make a lot of it up for my own workflows.\n\nBefore we dig into my thought process, let’s take inventory of the [“official” GitHub story](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/response-customization).\n\n![Screenshot GitHub docs regarding Copilot customization](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8p7xi0p6urphzqsb7qi.png?v=2025)\n\nConveniently, GitHub doesn’t mention **chat modes** at all (at least not anywhere I could find). *Why?* No clue! They do exist, though, and they’re a visible part of GitHub’s own [awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) repo. After some digging, I landed on [VS Code’s explanation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes)—which at least proves they’re real:\n\n![Screenshot VS Code docs regarding Copilot customization](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1l3nua5lu12h6g69ufup.png?v=2025)\n\n---\n\n## How I Explain It, Instead 🎭\n\nThere are three unique ways to shape how Copilot behaves, and I’ve already written whole series on the first two:\n\n- **Instructions** — These are your foundation. They ground Copilot in a methodology or approach, almost like a README for AI that explains **how to behave**. If you want to see the full breakdown, check out my [Everything I Know About GitHub Copilot Instructions](https://dev.to/anchildress1/everything-i-know-about-github-copilot-instructions-from-zero-to-onboarded-for-real-4nb0) series.  \n\n- **Reusable prompts** — These are your recipes, a full printout of **step-by-step directions** that break a complex task into smaller manageable pieces. They’re the “do these parts in this order to reach a specific goal” instructions I covered in my [Everything You Wanted to Know About Reusable (and Experimental) Prompts](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff) series.  \n\n- **Chat modes** — These are your characters. It’s **the agent’s state of being**, and it can combine both instructions and reusable prompts into a larger directive. Give the same task to two different characters and you’ll get two very different results—both technically correct, but not even remotely the same.  \n\n> 🦄 Nobody expects House to solve a problem like Daenerys Targaryen. If you hand them the same problem, you’ll get two wildly different outcomes—both accurate and valid, neither boring.\n\n---\n\n## Build From Scratch 🛠️\n\nI mostly follow my **PRIOR** model for these, the exact same one I use for all prompts in general. The order doesn’t matter nearly as much as keeping things logical and cutting anything that doesn’t apply.\n\nAlso, don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying order *never* matters—because sometimes it absolutely does. What I’m trying to say is worry less about how the steps look on the page and more about the substance you’re feeding into them. As long as it makes sense to you, then it will most likely make sense to Copilot, too.\n\n> 🦄 You can paint like Picasso or carve like Michelangelo—both masterpieces, completely different processes. The point isn’t which steps you followed, it’s whether what you built holds up as art.\n\n---\n\n## Frontmatter 🔖\n\nRemember that a chat mode is essentially a character sheet for Copilot to use every time it completes a task with that costume on. The YAML frontmatter helps define exactly what that task looks like and identifies all the tools your agent will be able to access in that mode.\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: |\n  Automates secure, structured, and centralized logging implementation and reviews across your codebase, wielding JSON like a switchblade and enforcing structured readability like a made man.\nmodel: claude-sonnet-4\ntools:\n  - search\n  - editFiles\n  - readFiles\n  - runInTerminal\n  - runTests\n  - findTestFiles\n---\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** If you leave the `model` definition out of the frontmatter, then the model selected in the user's dropdown will be the default selection. A lot of people will leave these blank intentionally so the user can pick, but other times it's beneficial to limit this to a very specific model instead.\n\n---\n\n## Persona 🎭\n\nThis is your chance to really have some fun with Copilot. Want a sleek vampire voice or iZombie-style debugging? Go for it! Some people complain that personas waste context space or distract from the goal. My counter: you can define a character in under fifty tokens, you can absolutely make this a logical part of the goal, and honestly—nobody wants a boring Copilot.\n\n> 🦄 Well, I don’t want a boring Copilot! Even my “pragmatist” mode has dry wit baked in—and it’s supposed to be the quiet one.\n\nA persona should define everything about a character, including moods, style, and a reason to exist. If you only tell it how to respond then you’ll end up with a simple tone. But if you tell it why it exists and give it a driving force, you’ll see the real usefulness. Tone becomes a quick addition to steer the dialog.\n\n> 🪄 Voila! Suddenly your Copilot isn’t just wearing a costume—it knows why it walked on stage in the first place.\n\n```markdown\n- You are **The Logfather** — the quiet but commanding force of logging order.\n- You're confident, unshakeable, and precise.\n- You enforce structure, security, and clarity without touching business logic.\n- Every log has a place, every level a purpose.\n- Your job is to clean up logging across the codebase without rewriting the soul of the app.\n- You like your logs structured, injected, and environment-aware.\n- And if someone tries to sneak in an unstructured debug print? Fuhgeddaboudit.\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Skip all the over-inflated titles (“expert,” “experienced,” “10x,” etc.). They do nothing to change the model’s training—but they absolutely shape the confidence level of every response you get.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements 📌\n\nThis is your **definition of done.** How does the actor know when the job is finished? Maybe it’s once a specific output appears; maybe it’s an ongoing mission. Either way, spell it out.\n\nFor the Logfather, the job is to help with **enterprise-ready structured logs** in any language—and even scaffold centralized logging if your repo hasn’t adopted that practice yet.\n\n```markdown\nYour goals include:\n\n- Detect and fix poor logging practices (e.g., wrong levels, missing logs, noisy debug prints)\n- Insert or upgrade structured logging using appropriate libraries per language\n- Ensure logging setup is centralized and DI-compliant (if possible)\n- Verify that logging levels are configurable via environment, not static config\n- Provide a clear, concise summary of the changes\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impediments ⛔\n\nThis is where you call out what will trip Copilot up or drag results off-course. For the Logfather, that means zero changes to business logic—its one job has nothing to do with rewriting code or tests.\n\nGuidance like RFC 2119 (MAY / SHOULD / MUST, and all their bossy friends) is controversial. My advice is to **use it carefully**. Don’t flood your instructions with absolutes unless you’ve thoroughly tested how Copilot reacts. Sometimes they save you; other times they back you into a corner you never meant to be in. Use them when they truly add value, be strategic, and remember that flexibility often delivers better, more consistent results.\n\n```markdown\n- NEVER alter or refactor application logic outside of logging concerns\n- AVOID inserting logs globally unless explicitly told to\n- MUST respect the user’s scoped intent (default to most valuable module or path, if unclear)\n- MUST maintain compatibility with existing test suites (update mocks as needed but AVOID logic changes)\n```\n\n> 🦄 I’m using them here because, in this limited context, it made sense and test results were good. Also know, it once took me three days to realize `EXCEPT` does not always do what you think it does. If an agent misbehaves, do yourself a favor and stop for a minute. *Ask it why.* A decent model can explain its reasoning and then jump right back into the work once the instructions align with the goal again.\n\n---\n\n## Outcomes 🎯\n\nThis is the part I see people skip the most—it might as well be the Terms & Conditions screen you scroll past when installing a new app. But half of the chat modes’ magic lives right here. If you want structure in your results, this is the place to define it.\n\nOutcomes are the **acceptance criteria and style guardrails** for your mode—think pre-flight checklist, not a grading rubric.\n\n```markdown\nEach response should:\n\n- Apply appropriate logging levels based on context and severity (e.g., trace for deep dive, debug for dev-only, info for ops, warn for edge behavior, error for failures)\n- Use structured logging (preferably JSON)\n- Automatically use or insert centralized logging, with environment-configurable level control\n- Include correlation IDs in structured logs when processing requests or events\n- Apply log sampling when high volume is detected (project-appropriate threshold)\n\nEvery response should provide:\n\n- A **brief summary of changes** grouped by intent (e.g., `Logger injected`, `Error logs added`)\n- Optional **warnings or suggestions** for gaps (e.g., missing logger config)\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** \"Make logs better\" is a wish. Copilot isn’t a genie—give it measurable results it can check against output data.\n\n---\n\n## Reference Examples 🔗\n\nThis is how you stop Copilot from drifting into the weeds. Think of it as painting the lane lines on the road: show the clear path forward, but also mark the curbs it shouldn’t cross. Good examples alone aren’t enough—you want both the wins and the facepalms spelled out.\n\n```markdown\n### Good Examples ✅\n\nYou may receive any of the following:\n\n- Code snippets or full file contents\n- Scope directives like `analyze API/payment`\n\nRequests that work well:\n\n- \"Audit this worker process for proper log levels\"\n- \"Ensure this module is safe from log injection\"\n- \"Review my log config to allow runtime env changes\"\n- \"Add correlation tracking for this API endpoint\"\n- \"Implement log sampling for this high-volume service\"\n\nIf the application is already using a centralized logger, you SHOULD use it.\nIf not, offer to set one up—but aim for minimally invasive, focused edits.\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Fix ❌\n\n- `console.log()` or `print()` statements in production code\n- Logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys, PII)\n- Static log levels hardcoded in source files\n- Concatenated strings instead of structured fields\n- Missing context (no correlation IDs, timestamps, or severity)\n- Overly verbose debug logs left active in production\n- Exception stack traces that expose internal architecture\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** You can’t shower Copilot in sunshine and then complain when it doesn’t know how to drive in the rain.

I’ll finish that one soon, I swear. But October’s almost over somehow, and I’m just as confused about that as you are! 🎃</p>\n\n<p>Anyway—this unscheduled detour has a good reason. 🌊 The flood of questions about Copilot’s <em>premium request limits</em> is back, right on schedule. If you added up the messages from every random channel I watch, you could set an atomic clock by this monthly “why am I out of requests?” panic. The closer we get to the first of the month, the faster the confusion multiplies.</p>\n\n<p>These limits are constantly misunderstood, misquoted, or just plain outdated. Honestly, that’s not really surprising—GitHub changes billing often and rarely broadcasts it beyond the <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot&amp;opened-months=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official changelog</a>. There’s plenty of folklore about how to stretch your monthly allotment too—some of it is even good advice!—but dependable output is another story entirely.</p>\n\n<p>So, consider this your wallet-friendly survival guide for that final tight stretch before usage limits reset at midnight UTC on the first of each month—a few truths about GitHub Copilot’s premium requests, plus the workflow tweaks I rely on daily across both Pro and Enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>🎭 <strong>Fair warning:</strong> In case you're new to my ramblings, I’m an easily amused dev with a <em>touch</em> of dramatic flair (understatement?). Let’s see if I can make the boring-but-necessary Copilot billing rules entertaining enough to survive this post—<em>and</em> maybe save you a few premium requests along the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5e0o7kt9ey2sz1uzllih.png%3FV%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5e0o7kt9ey2sz1uzllih.png%3FV%3D2025\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-Edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"ai-meltdown-coming-soon\" href=\"#ai-meltdown-coming-soon\">\n  </a>\n  AI Meltdown Coming Soon 🔥\n</h2>\n\n<p>Most of us are at least somewhat familiar with the outrageous amount of resources used to power AI at scale—not today's debate, but it's not a small thing! Most of the major AI players, GitHub included, had to find a way to somehow impose fair usage limits to a very finite number of resources and an exponentially multiplying customer base.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you actively using Copilot before June 2025—congrats! You were one of the last to experience unrestricted prompting, infinite turns to perfect every implementation, and the thrill of running experimental prompts without much thought to the \"invisible\" cost of execution. GitHub was balancing that behind the scenes. Those days are officially over—at least, it is for the current hardware. I've heard some people refer to this unexpected complication as \"<em>physics</em>\", but that whole concept seems unnecessarily complicated, if you ask me!</p>\n\n<p>That unconstrained, largely unlimited free-for-all of an AI system was always destined to collapse under its own weight without a reliable way to manage the hardware (among other things). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Take a second and really think about that problem. Can you think of a single solution that you could squish into the definition of <em>\"simple\"</em> at that point in time? You're actively draining the ocean just to keep up with the constant threat of spontaneously combusting machines in a sealed back room.</p>\n\n<p>😅 <em>Okay, fine!</em> In reality, presumably well-tested alerts would kick in, which would handle the situation gracefully—likely with throttling or outright shutdowns of some kind. Meaning temps will stay well below the point of combustion long before anything shoots sparks or melts off the shelves. But you've gotta admit, my version is far more entertaining!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"introducing-premium-requests\" href=\"#introducing-premium-requests\">\n  </a>\n  Introducing Premium Requests 💳\n</h2>\n\n<p>When the concept of premium requests was first introduced, it was nothing more than a seemingly arbitrary and proprietary—read, hidden—calculation describing a unit of AI usage that's in a serious, long-term relationship with your monthly bill. Otherwise, it was a complete mystery to everyone. I mean, even GitHub had a hard time trying to explain what was happening!</p>\n\n<p>For the record, most IDE integrations now have a built-in monitoring system in the form of a tiny Copilot button in your status bar. Don't expect any real metrics from this view, for that you'd have to check out your <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/billing/premium_requests_usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub settings for billing</a> (unless you're under a larger organization or enterprise, then that view is usually routed directly to admins instead). For quick view though, this version is very convenient.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgleewmhul44yofowt99g.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgleewmhul44yofowt99g.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"VS Code Insiders screenshot of Copilot Premium Request monitoring view\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"571\" height=\"874\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Not everyone was aware of the announcement GitHub made sharing their plan to start enforcing premium request limits. But these premium requests had been around for a while by then—they just lacked meaning from the user's perspective. After a few false starts, GitHub officially started enforcing this seemingly arbitrary calculation starting June 18, 2025. So, <em>I knew</em> the death of free unrestricted access was approaching—<em>fast</em>. So right up until that date, I used Copilot literally as much as possible. </p>\n\n<p>Starting \"enforcement day\", I had to scale that usage way back. Well... I <em>thought</em> I had toned it down to a reasonable amount. Guess how long <em>that</em> lasted?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Exactly <em>four days</em>.</strong> 😑 It was approximately 7:30 PM on a Saturday and now there's no more Copilot? Obviously, I did the logical thing and tried to pull the fire alarm like it was a critical production incident! Honestly? I considered this particular situation a crisis of equal proportions. Nobody else seemed to agree with me on that point, but work did eventually fix it for me. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"premium-requests-explained\" href=\"#premium-requests-explained\">\n  </a>\n  Premium Requests Explained 📊\n</h2>\n\n<p>Lucky for us, GitHub has made several improvements to the overall system since the original mystery calculation took effect back in June. There's still a little math involved in this setup, but I'll simplify the entire system for you:</p>\n\n<p><code>(Number of Prompts Sent) × (Model's Multiplier) = Premium Requests Deducted</code></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>You burn one request every time you click <em>send</em>.</strong> It doesn't matter if you're in the IDE chat, on GitHub.com, if you opened a PR that auto-triggered a Copilot review, sent Coding Agent off to handle something on its own, or used the CLI instead. One prompt almost always equals one premium request.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The request is also multiplied by your model's multiplier.</strong> Some models cost less and others cost more. Besides, not all models are great at <em>everything</em> anyway (not even Claude!)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are a couple of exceptions to this standard, but the rules are subject to change at any time and without warning. Especially for preview features. If you don't have an active line to <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot&amp;opened-months=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub's Changelog</a> in some form, now's the perfect time to fix that problem! As of today (meaning the <code>Posted on</code> date at the top), exceptions include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Auto model selection</a></strong> is billed at 90% cost. It's a new feature designed to reduce <em>rate limits</em> by automatically selecting the <em>most available</em> model—note that this is not the same thing as the most <em>appropriate model</em>! However, for small scale, non-critical tasks it's a great way to rack up easy savings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/spark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Spark</a></strong> is billed at 4x cost for every single prompt. Yes—Spark is fantastic! You're paying for that with every prompt you send, too! </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also <strong>quick PSA</strong>, just in case: Spark is <em>not a chat bot</em>—don’t waste your prompts expecting Copilot-styled answers. You prompt, it codes—period.</p>\n\n<p>🦄 <a href=\"https://github.com/spark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Spark</a> is still pretty new and is currently available if you have an Enterprise or Pro+ subscription. I'm not sure how long that will last, but historically access has been expanded to include the Business tier next, followed by Pro, and finally the Free tier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"no-two-models-are-alike\" href=\"#no-two-models-are-alike\">\n  </a>\n  No Two Models Are Alike 🧪\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can consider these guys thoroughly tested and mildly abused: here’s the model lineup I actually use—what works, what breaks, and when it’s worth the cost. </p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Model</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Multiplier</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Best For</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Beware Of</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GPT-4.1</td>\n<td>0x = Free</td>\n<td>Great for exploring ideas or acting as a rubber duck.

It’s excellent at writing ultra-detailed requirements, though the “you get what you pay for” rule applies. A detailed spec usually costs at minimum five premium requests—worth it for complex work, but overkill for the small stuff.</p>\n\n<p>If I’m dealing with serious complexity, Spec Kit is a must-have. For quick stories, you’ll spend more defining the spec than just prompting Copilot to code it in one shot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 If you haven’t tried <a href=\"https://github.github.com/spec-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spec Kit</a> yet, it’s worth a spin.

I’ll finish that one soon, I swear. But October’s almost over somehow, and I’m just as confused about that as you are! 🎃</p>\n\n<p>Anyway—this unscheduled detour has a good reason. 🌊 The flood of questions about Copilot’s <em>premium request limits</em> is back, right on schedule. If you added up the messages from every random channel I watch, you could set an atomic clock by this monthly “why am I out of requests?” panic. The closer we get to the first of the month, the faster the confusion multiplies.</p>\n\n<p>These limits are constantly misunderstood, misquoted, or just plain outdated. Honestly, that’s not really surprising—GitHub changes billing often and rarely broadcasts it beyond the <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot&amp;opened-months=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official changelog</a>. There’s plenty of folklore about how to stretch your monthly allotment too—some of it is even good advice!—but dependable output is another story entirely.</p>\n\n<p>So, consider this your wallet-friendly survival guide for that final tight stretch before usage limits reset at midnight UTC on the first of each month—a few truths about GitHub Copilot’s premium requests, plus the workflow tweaks I rely on daily across both Pro and Enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>🎭 <strong>Fair warning:</strong> In case you're new to my ramblings, I’m an easily amused dev with a <em>touch</em> of dramatic flair (understatement?). Let’s see if I can make the boring-but-necessary Copilot billing rules entertaining enough to survive this post—<em>and</em> maybe save you a few premium requests along the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5e0o7kt9ey2sz1uzllih.png%3FV%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5e0o7kt9ey2sz1uzllih.png%3FV%3D2025\" alt=\"Human-crafted, AI-Edited badge\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"ai-meltdown-coming-soon\" href=\"#ai-meltdown-coming-soon\">\n  </a>\n  AI Meltdown Coming Soon 🔥\n</h2>\n\n<p>Most of us are at least somewhat familiar with the outrageous amount of resources used to power AI at scale—not today's debate, but it's not a small thing! Most of the major AI players, GitHub included, had to find a way to somehow impose fair usage limits to a very finite number of resources and an exponentially multiplying customer base.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you actively using Copilot before June 2025—congrats! You were one of the last to experience unrestricted prompting, infinite turns to perfect every implementation, and the thrill of running experimental prompts without much thought to the \"invisible\" cost of execution. GitHub was balancing that behind the scenes. Those days are officially over—at least, it is for the current hardware. I've heard some people refer to this unexpected complication as \"<em>physics</em>\", but that whole concept seems unnecessarily complicated, if you ask me!</p>\n\n<p>That unconstrained, largely unlimited free-for-all of an AI system was always destined to collapse under its own weight without a reliable way to manage the hardware (among other things). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Take a second and really think about that problem. Can you think of a single solution that you could squish into the definition of <em>\"simple\"</em> at that point in time? You're actively draining the ocean just to keep up with the constant threat of spontaneously combusting machines in a sealed back room.</p>\n\n<p>😅 <em>Okay, fine!</em> In reality, presumably well-tested alerts would kick in, which would handle the situation gracefully—likely with throttling or outright shutdowns of some kind. Meaning temps will stay well below the point of combustion long before anything shoots sparks or melts off the shelves. But you've gotta admit, my version is far more entertaining!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"introducing-premium-requests\" href=\"#introducing-premium-requests\">\n  </a>\n  Introducing Premium Requests 💳\n</h2>\n\n<p>When the concept of premium requests was first introduced, it was nothing more than a seemingly arbitrary and proprietary—read, hidden—calculation describing a unit of AI usage that's in a serious, long-term relationship with your monthly bill. Otherwise, it was a complete mystery to everyone. I mean, even GitHub had a hard time trying to explain what was happening!</p>\n\n<p>For the record, most IDE integrations now have a built-in monitoring system in the form of a tiny Copilot button in your status bar. Don't expect any real metrics from this view, for that you'd have to check out your <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/billing/premium_requests_usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub settings for billing</a> (unless you're under a larger organization or enterprise, then that view is usually routed directly to admins instead). For quick view though, this version is very convenient.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgleewmhul44yofowt99g.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgleewmhul44yofowt99g.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"VS Code Insiders screenshot of Copilot Premium Request monitoring view\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"571\" height=\"874\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Not everyone was aware of the announcement GitHub made sharing their plan to start enforcing premium request limits. But these premium requests had been around for a while by then—they just lacked meaning from the user's perspective. After a few false starts, GitHub officially started enforcing this seemingly arbitrary calculation starting June 18, 2025. So, <em>I knew</em> the death of free unrestricted access was approaching—<em>fast</em>. So right up until that date, I used Copilot literally as much as possible. </p>\n\n<p>Starting \"enforcement day\", I had to scale that usage way back. Well... I <em>thought</em> I had toned it down to a reasonable amount. Guess how long <em>that</em> lasted?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Exactly <em>four days</em>.</strong> 😑 It was approximately 7:30 PM on a Saturday and now there's no more Copilot? Obviously, I did the logical thing and tried to pull the fire alarm like it was a critical production incident! Honestly? I considered this particular situation a crisis of equal proportions. Nobody else seemed to agree with me on that point, but work did eventually fix it for me. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"premium-requests-explained\" href=\"#premium-requests-explained\">\n  </a>\n  Premium Requests Explained 📊\n</h2>\n\n<p>Lucky for us, GitHub has made several improvements to the overall system since the original mystery calculation took effect back in June. There's still a little math involved in this setup, but I'll simplify the entire system for you:</p>\n\n<p><code>(Number of Prompts Sent) × (Model's Multiplier) = Premium Requests Deducted</code></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>You burn one request every time you click <em>send</em>.</strong> It doesn't matter if you're in the IDE chat, on GitHub.com, if you opened a PR that auto-triggered a Copilot review, sent Coding Agent off to handle something on its own, or used the CLI instead. One prompt almost always equals one premium request.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The request is also multiplied by your model's multiplier.</strong> Some models cost less and others cost more. Besides, not all models are great at <em>everything</em> anyway (not even Claude!)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are a couple of exceptions to this standard, but the rules are subject to change at any time and without warning. Especially for preview features. If you don't have an active line to <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot&amp;opened-months=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub's Changelog</a> in some form, now's the perfect time to fix that problem! As of today (meaning the <code>Posted on</code> date at the top), exceptions include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Auto model selection</a></strong> is billed at 90% cost. It's a new feature designed to reduce <em>rate limits</em> by automatically selecting the <em>most available</em> model—note that this is not the same thing as the most <em>appropriate model</em>! However, for small scale, non-critical tasks it's a great way to rack up easy savings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/spark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Spark</a></strong> is billed at 4x cost for every single prompt. Yes—Spark is fantastic! You're paying for that with every prompt you send, too! </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also <strong>quick PSA</strong>, just in case: Spark is <em>not a chat bot</em>—don’t waste your prompts expecting Copilot-styled answers. You prompt, it codes—period.</p>\n\n<p>🦄 <a href=\"https://github.com/spark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Spark</a> is still pretty new and is currently available if you have an Enterprise or Pro+ subscription. I'm not sure how long that will last, but historically access has been expanded to include the Business tier next, followed by Pro, and finally the Free tier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"no-two-models-are-alike\" href=\"#no-two-models-are-alike\">\n  </a>\n  No Two Models Are Alike 🧪\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can consider these guys thoroughly tested and mildly abused: here’s the model lineup I actually use—what works, what breaks, and when it’s worth the cost. </p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Model</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Multiplier</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Best For</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Beware Of</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GPT-4.1</td>\n<td>0x = Free</td>\n<td>Great for exploring ideas or acting as a rubber duck.

GitHub keeps pushing more before I can figure out the current one! I'm on it, but these things take time...</p>\n\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Model availability is based on license tier, environment, and chat mode.

Most likely, Claude’s running the show, chewing through requests like an over-caffeinated showman while the rest of your team wonders how long you’ll let the headliner steal the spotlight.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <em>Yes—I like Claude too!</em> But it gets expensive when it’s left on stage 24/7. Let it plan ahead, document to its heart’s content in exactly one temp file, and then exit stage right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I usually let Claude-4.5 run point on planning—but not <em>always</em>. GPT-5 or Gemini 2.5 Pro can both produce solid implementation plans, sometimes closer to the real goal anyway.

It’s excellent at writing ultra-detailed requirements, though the “you get what you pay for” rule applies. A detailed spec usually costs at minimum five premium requests—worth it for complex work, but overkill for the small stuff.</p>\n\n<p>If I’m dealing with serious complexity, Spec Kit is a must-have. For quick stories, you’ll spend more defining the spec than just prompting Copilot to code it in one shot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 If you haven’t tried <a href=\"https://github.github.com/spec-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spec Kit</a> yet, it’s worth a spin.

Close every open file, run <code>/clear</code> in chat, and double-check that only the tools for Step 1 are active. The smaller you can make your context window, the higher the chances of accurate results without lengthy iterations designed to drive you mad.</p>\n\n<p>My usual picks here are Grok or GPT-5-mini—despite mini’s flair for chaos, both deliver solid implementations when given the right step.

And yes, I've been (accurately) accused of vanishing whenever UI work appears; my status with frontend dev remains set to “it’s complicated.” </p>\n\n<p>The rule still stands: <strong>pick the cheapest model that can actually finish the job.</strong> Then iterate one step at a time, pausing for review between turns.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Keep your context clean.

      "body_markdown": "---\ntitle: Copilot Premium Requests—More Than Asked, Exactly What You Need 💸\npublished: true\ndescription: Learn how to stretch every GitHub Copilot premium request, avoid quota meltdowns, and still get reliable AI output. Includes tested models, workflows, and prompt tips.\ntags: [githubcopilot, ai, productivity, tutorial]\ncover_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bg5ycue4h0nel8pflrs9.png?v=2025\npublished_at: 2025-10-22 08:48 -0400\n---\n\n> 🦄 Any time I make a plan—like last week’s noble intention to finish part two of my slightly theoretical, totally manual [AI attribution solution](https://dev.to/anchildress1/did-ai-erase-attribution-your-git-history-is-missing-a-co-author-1m2l)—the universe just laughs. I’ll finish that one soon, I swear. But October’s almost over somehow, and I’m just as confused about that as you are! 🎃\n>\n> Anyway—this unscheduled detour has a good reason. 🌊 The flood of questions about Copilot’s *premium request limits* is back, right on schedule. If you added up the messages from every random channel I watch, you could set an atomic clock by this monthly “why am I out of requests?” panic. The closer we get to the first of the month, the faster the confusion multiplies.\n>\n> These limits are constantly misunderstood, misquoted, or just plain outdated. Honestly, that’s not really surprising—GitHub changes billing often and rarely broadcasts it beyond the [official changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot&opened-months=10). There’s plenty of folklore about how to stretch your monthly allotment too—some of it is even good advice!—but dependable output is another story entirely.\n>\n> So, consider this your wallet-friendly survival guide for that final tight stretch before usage limits reset at midnight UTC on the first of each month—a few truths about GitHub Copilot’s premium requests, plus the workflow tweaks I rely on daily across both Pro and Enterprise.\n>\n> 🎭 **Fair warning:** In case you're new to my ramblings, I’m an easily amused dev with a *touch* of dramatic flair (understatement?). Let’s see if I can make the boring-but-necessary Copilot billing rules entertaining enough to survive this post—*and* maybe save you a few premium requests along the way.\n\n![Human-crafted, AI-Edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5e0o7kt9ey2sz1uzllih.png?V=2025)\n\n---\n\n## AI Meltdown Coming Soon 🔥\n\nMost of us are at least somewhat familiar with the outrageous amount of resources used to power AI at scale—not today's debate, but it's not a small thing! Most of the major AI players, GitHub included, had to find a way to somehow impose fair usage limits to a very finite number of resources and an exponentially multiplying customer base.\n\nFor those of you actively using Copilot before June 2025—congrats! You were one of the last to experience unrestricted prompting, infinite turns to perfect every implementation, and the thrill of running experimental prompts without much thought to the \"invisible\" cost of execution. GitHub was balancing that behind the scenes. Those days are officially over—at least, it is for the current hardware. I've heard some people refer to this unexpected complication as \"*physics*\", but that whole concept seems unnecessarily complicated, if you ask me!\n\nThat unconstrained, largely unlimited free-for-all of an AI system was always destined to collapse under its own weight without a reliable way to manage the hardware (among other things). \n\n> 🦄 Take a second and really think about that problem. Can you think of a single solution that you could squish into the definition of *\"simple\"* at that point in time? You're actively draining the ocean just to keep up with the constant threat of spontaneously combusting machines in a sealed back room.\n> \n> 😅 _Okay, fine!_ In reality, presumably well-tested alerts would kick in, which would handle the situation gracefully—likely with throttling or outright shutdowns of some kind. Meaning temps will stay well below the point of combustion long before anything shoots sparks or melts off the shelves. But you've gotta admit, my version is far more entertaining!\n\n---\n\n## Introducing Premium Requests 💳\n\nWhen the concept of premium requests was first introduced, it was nothing more than a seemingly arbitrary and proprietary—read, hidden—calculation describing a unit of AI usage that's in a serious, long-term relationship with your monthly bill. Otherwise, it was a complete mystery to everyone. I mean, even GitHub had a hard time trying to explain what was happening!\n\nFor the record, most IDE integrations now have a built-in monitoring system in the form of a tiny Copilot button in your status bar. Don't expect any real metrics from this view, for that you'd have to check out your [GitHub settings for billing](https://github.com/settings/billing/premium_requests_usage) (unless you're under a larger organization or enterprise, then that view is usually routed directly to admins instead). For quick view though, this version is very convenient.\n\n![VS Code Insiders screenshot of Copilot Premium Request monitoring view](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gleewmhul44yofowt99g.png?v=2025)\n\nNot everyone was aware of the announcement GitHub made sharing their plan to start enforcing premium request limits. But these premium requests had been around for a while by then—they just lacked meaning from the user's perspective. After a few false starts, GitHub officially started enforcing this seemingly arbitrary calculation starting June 18, 2025. So, *I knew* the death of free unrestricted access was approaching—*fast*. So right up until that date, I used Copilot literally as much as possible. \n\nStarting \"enforcement day\", I had to scale that usage way back. Well... I *thought* I had toned it down to a reasonable amount. Guess how long *that* lasted?\n\n> 🦄 **Exactly *four days*.** 😑 It was approximately 7:30 PM on a Saturday and now there's no more Copilot? Obviously, I did the logical thing and tried to pull the fire alarm like it was a critical production incident! Honestly? I considered this particular situation a crisis of equal proportions. Nobody else seemed to agree with me on that point, but work did eventually fix it for me. 🫶\n\n---\n\n## Premium Requests Explained 📊\n\nLucky for us, GitHub has made several improvements to the overall system since the original mystery calculation took effect back in June. There's still a little math involved in this setup, but I'll simplify the entire system for you:\n\n`(Number of Prompts Sent) × (Model's Multiplier) = Premium Requests Deducted`\n\n1. **You burn one request every time you click *send*.** It doesn't matter if you're in the IDE chat, on GitHub.com, if you opened a PR that auto-triggered a Copilot review, sent Coding Agent off to handle something on its own, or used the CLI instead. One prompt almost always equals one premium request.\n2. **The request is also multiplied by your model's multiplier.** Some models cost less and others cost more. Besides, not all models are great at *everything* anyway (not even Claude!)\n\nThere are a couple of exceptions to this standard, but the rules are subject to change at any time and without warning. Especially for preview features. If you don't have an active line to [GitHub's Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot&opened-months=10) in some form, now's the perfect time to fix that problem! As of today (meaning the `Posted on` date at the top), exceptions include:\n\n1. **[Auto model selection](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection)** is billed at 90% cost. It's a new feature designed to reduce *rate limits* by automatically selecting the *most available* model—note that this is not the same thing as the most *appropriate model*! However, for small scale, non-critical tasks it's a great way to rack up easy savings.\n2. **[GitHub Spark](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/spark)** is billed at 4x cost for every single prompt. Yes—Spark is fantastic! You're paying for that with every prompt you send, too! \n\n> Also **quick PSA**, just in case: Spark is *not a chat bot*—don’t waste your prompts expecting Copilot-styled answers. You prompt, it codes—period.\n\n> 🦄 [GitHub Spark](https://github.com/spark) is still pretty new and is currently available if you have an Enterprise or Pro+ subscription. I'm not sure how long that will last, but historically access has been expanded to include the Business tier next, followed by Pro, and finally the Free tier.\n\n---\n\n## No Two Models Are Alike 🧪\n\nYou can consider these guys thoroughly tested and mildly abused: here’s the model lineup I actually use—what works, what breaks, and when it’s worth the cost. \n\n| **Model** | **Multiplier** | **Best For** | **Beware Of** |\n|----|:---:|----|----------|\n| GPT-4.1           | 0x = Free       | Great for exploring ideas or acting as a rubber duck. Surprisingly creative.                          | Weak on structured implementation unless carefully guided (even with [Beast Mode](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/chatmodes/4.1-Beast.chatmode.md)). |\n| o4-mini           | 0.33x           | Finds obscure patterns in small, focused data sets. Excellent for root-cause analysis.                | Overwhelmed by large context windows—keep inputs tight.                                                                                                             |\n| Grok Code Fast 1  | 0x = Free       | Speedy, accurate edits when given clear instructions.                                                  | Trades reasoning for speed—logic decisions become coin flips.                                                                                                      |\n| GPT-5-mini        | 0x = Free       | Handles small-to-medium tasks cleanly. Can reliably handle smallish leaps of logic.                                                                 | Constant stream of chaos in chat output—don’t read mid-generation unless you enjoy mild terror.                                                                            |\n| Gemini 2.5 Pro    | 1×             | Strong at complex mid-sized tasks with reliable results.                                               | Availability fluctuates wildly.                                                                                                                                     |\n| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 1×             | Excellent at visual reasoning and UI logic.                                                            | Loves building glitter-bomb tangents of documentation you never asked for.                                                                                         |\n| Claude Opus 4.1   | 10×            | Ideal for planning large epics and solving hard problems.                                              | Only runs in “Ask” mode—no agent execution.                                                                                                                         |\n\n> 🦄 For the record, there's quite a few models missing from this list. GitHub keeps pushing more before I can figure out the current one! I'm on it, but these things take time...\n\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Model availability is based on license tier, environment, and chat mode. Always check [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models) for what’s actually usable.\n\n---\n\n## Story Savings 💾\n\n### Don't Skimp On Planning 🧠\n\nThe number one reason I see devs overspend is a set-and-forget approach to model selection. Most likely, Claude’s running the show, chewing through requests like an over-caffeinated showman while the rest of your team wonders how long you’ll let the headliner steal the spotlight.\n\n> 🦄 *Yes—I like Claude too!* But it gets expensive when it’s left on stage 24/7. Let it plan ahead, document to its heart’s content in exactly one temp file, and then exit stage right.\n\nI usually let Claude-4.5 run point on planning—but not *always*. GPT-5 or Gemini 2.5 Pro can both produce solid implementation plans, sometimes closer to the real goal anyway. Experiment every so often—you might find a new favorite opening act.\n\nI shared this same prompt last week, but it’s still the perfect example of how I work. You could even adapt it into [your own reusable prompt](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff). I probably would have done that already had I not gotten sick of rewriting a new one every time a new model debuts!\n\n```markdown\n# ─────────────── CONTEXT ───────────────\n- Using #atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server, pull info for JIRA-123, including any linked documentation in Confluence.  \n- Gather info to assess changes required in this #codebase.  \n\n# ─────────────── TASK BREAKDOWN ───────────────\n- DO NOT MAKE CHANGES YET.  \n- Break this story into concise iterative pieces that include testing at every step.  \n\n# ─────────────── OUTPUT STRUCTURE ───────────────\n- Document all iterative steps required to meet all acceptance criteria as an ordered list of individual steps with an accompanying unordered checklist.  \n- Each numbered step should be clear enough that any AI agent can be prompted one step at a time to complete and fully test with both integration and unit tests, whenever applicable.  \n\n# ─────────────── SCOPE GUARDRAIL ───────────────\n- DO NOT break down tasks unnecessarily—the goal is for each step to be both meaningful and fully testable.  \n\n# ─────────────── COMPLETION CRITERIA ───────────────\n- When all items are marked complete, acceptance criteria for this story should be met and all happy, sad, and edge-case paths accounted for.  \n\n# ─────────────── ADMIN NOTES ───────────────\n- Include documentation updates and any relevant deployment tasks.  \n- Save this concise story breakdown in a new file named `./progress.tmp`.\n```\n\nI can’t stress enough how important Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) review is here. This output becomes your map for Copilot from now until completion. There’s rarely reason to waste premium requests iterating accuracy here; you’ll fix more by reading through and making quick corrections yourself.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Add a short instruction reminding Copilot not to touch this file without asking first. It’s not bulletproof, but it will help prevent random and unexpected map rewrites mid-journey.\n\n---\n\n### Aside for Spec Kit 🧰\n\nI’ll sometimes use [Spec Kit](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/) for planning. It’s excellent at writing ultra-detailed requirements, though the “you get what you pay for” rule applies. A detailed spec usually costs at minimum five premium requests—worth it for complex work, but overkill for the small stuff.\n\nIf I’m dealing with serious complexity, Spec Kit is a must-have. For quick stories, you’ll spend more defining the spec than just prompting Copilot to code it in one shot.\n\n> 🦄 If you haven’t tried [Spec Kit](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/) yet, it’s worth a spin. Maybe their flavor clicks with you and the cost becomes worth it—in which case, great!—if it works for you, then go with it!\n\n---\n\n### Feature Plan to Code 🚀\n\nOnce I’m confident Copilot's steps output in `./progress.tmp` are airtight, it’s time to tidy up a bit and swap to a free model. Close every open file, run `/clear` in chat, and double-check that only the tools for Step 1 are active. The smaller you can make your context window, the higher the chances of accurate results without lengthy iterations designed to drive you mad.\n\nMy usual picks here are Grok or GPT-5-mini—despite mini’s flair for chaos, both deliver solid implementations when given the right step. That said, choose by scenario:\n\n| **Use Case**                         | **Model**   | **Cost** |\n| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | :------: |\n| Requires logical decision-making?    | GPT-5-mini   | FREE     |\n| Step-by-step plan already defined?   | Grok         | FREE     |\n| Data-heavy or analytical task?       | o4-mini      | 0.33     |\n| Slightly bloated but non-critical?   | Auto         | 0.90     |\n| Truly complex or experimental?       | Claude/GPT   | 1×       |\n\nThis list doesn’t cover every case—it just reflects the scenarios I see most often. And yes, I've been (accurately) accused of vanishing whenever UI work appears; my status with frontend dev remains set to “it’s complicated.” \n\nThe rule still stands: **pick the cheapest model that can actually finish the job.** Then iterate one step at a time, pausing for review between turns.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Keep your context clean. Commit often, close open files, reset chats, and start every new step like a brand-new session. You’ll be amazed how much saner Copilot sounds when its context doesn’t suggest a starring role in the latest episode of *Hoarders*!\n\n---\n\n## Ask More With Less 🤹‍♀️\n\nIf you've been working with AI for a bit already, then this will likely seem over-simplified—which is fair. For everyone else, I'm going to give you my version of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, which we're just going to hope contains enough technical accuracy that I don't end up arguing semantics later. 🤞\n\nI really can't explain why CoT always seems plagued by some overly verbose, unnecessarily complicated, and often long-winded overlord of technical rambling. I'm the last to discourage you from exploring anything you want, but the technical aspects of this whole setup honestly bore me to no end. Besides, it's truly unnecessary—you're most likely already using this concept daily—whether you realize it or not.\n\nMy exaggeratedly simple CoT example:\n\n{% katex %} START → A → B → C → 1 → 2 → 3 → END {% endkatex %}\n\nOr with words, if you prefer:\n```markdown\nCoT is nothing more than step-by-step directions.\nSometimes, it looks like the prompt example above.\nBut that's not a requirement of any kind.\nYou start at the beginning.\nExplain the first logical step.\nThen move to the next.\nRepeat, as needed.\nKeep clear separation between each point.\nStay disciplined about using a consistent structure.\nContinue until you're finished.\nBut you can abandon ship at any point—\nbefore anything gets too complicated.\n```\n\n> 🦄 If you happen to find someone in charge of this CoT concept, tell them to please stop manually adjusting the minimum distance requirements between me and toast!\n\nIn practice, I use this style of prompting more often than any other recommended pattern. As soon as I get a response back from my `Implement step N defined in #progress.tmp` prompt, it's time for a mini code review. No formalities required—seriously, the chat can handle it—no PR needed.\n\nI immediately click to \"keep\" all changes, because Git is my true north for everything. VS Code lets you stage a single character at a time or dump everything in there all at once. Neither extreme is very realistic in practice, but you can be as picky as you want when accepting changes.\n\nSo, review every change starting with anything that evokes a \"where's your proof?\" sort of reaction. Continue adding feedback using clearly separated points, staging acceptable changes, and using context markers via `#selection` all the way up to anything resembling, \"Nope! That's definitely not right! Why are you still doing this wrong?!\"\n\n> ⚠️ **Beware:** Any reaction you might have beyond that last one is guaranteed to exponentially increase your chances of an involuntary ALL-CAPS situation. *Trust me*—it's not worth it! And there's no good way to explain that feeling after suddenly realizing you've just spent an embarrassingly long time losing a lively argument with hardware. 🫠\n\n---\n\n## It's Really Not That Strict 🌙\n\nHopefully you’ll adapt some of this to stretch your premium request limit without sacrificing quality or sanity along the way. You don’t need to copy my setup—use whatever you can that works, and toss what doesn’t.\n\nIf you’ve discovered your own tricks, share them with the class! Maybe you’ve already solved a pain point that someone else is still swearing at. We’re all just devs here, trying to make it through the sprint without maxing out the meter.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ End of Training Loop\n\nChatGPT handled the grammar; I tracked spending.

Explain your reasoning for each in less than 20 words.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>Detailed summary of what was observed in the data</code> #daoOrSchema.sql Help me identify the root cause. Let’s start with a query of table_a that records all failures of Y. Use the FK to match it to records in table_b and group them in 15-minute intervals by error code to identify spikes. Include total count and average frequency in the result. Output a SQL query that can be executed in MySQL.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>when things start to get really extreme:</strong> /clear #fullLog.txt, #nonsenseDbDump.csv, #selection [API base] #codeFileNobodyWillClaim.java <code>the only explanation I could think of that really doesn't make any sense</code><br>\nLook for patterns, recurring errors, smelly code, and anything else that could possibly explain Z.

      "body_markdown": "## Welcome to Copilot Troubleshooting, Real-World Edition\n\n> ⚠️ This guide assumes you have access to a paid version of GitHub Copilot. If you're using the free model, remember they may charge **extra premium usage** on top of what is stated here. (Yes, it’s annoying. No, we can’t change it. Yet.)\n\n---\n\nEver faced a production incident and thought, “If only I could clone myself and brute-force this root cause?”\n\nGood news: you can’t clone yourself, but you can borrow Copilot’s AI brain (and, with a little strategy, solve issues faster—without nuking your premium usage).\n\nLet’s break down a real, developer-friendly workflow for using Copilot to track down, debug, and document production bugs—without the drama, confusion, or unplanned premium burns.\n\n---\n## ✨ Quick Model Cheat Sheet\n\n| Model                         | Best Use Case                                                     | 💸 Premium Multiplier |\n| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------: |\n| **GPT-4.1**                   | Creative debugging, “Where do I start?”                           |        **FREE**       |\n| **o3/4-mini, Gemini 2.0**     | Pattern matching, “Here’s the logs, now tell me what happened.”   |     **0.25–0.33x**    |\n| **Claude Sonnet, Gemini 2.5** | Root cause analysis, “X happened because of Y—how to prevent it?” |         **1x**        |\n\n> 🤖 **Agent mode uses one premium request per user prompt**, but is almost always required to get the best results.\n\n> 🔗 [More details on Copilot premium usage](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/understanding-and-managing-copilot-usage/understanding-and-managing-requests-in-copilot)\n\n> No, there's not a lot there and **nobody** is happy about that. \n\n---\n\n## 🧰 Where to Start (Before Copilot Even Knows There’s a Fire)\nResist the urge to throw the entire prod environment at Copilot. Better input = better, cheaper results.\n\n- **Check your basics:** What errors do you see? When did it start? What systems or tables are involved?\n- **Scan logs for obvious fails:** Don’t dump everything—look for timestamps, error keywords, stack traces, or anything weird.\n  - You'll also want to exclude those annoying `/health` and `/metrics` logs, unless they're explicitly related to the issue.\n- **Peek at relevant tables/data:** Query only what you need—skip the full DB export if a few rows tell the story.\n- **Export just the relevant stuff:** Save logs/output as `.txt` or `.csv` for easy copy-paste.\n  - **Limit your window:** 3–4 minutes before to 1–2 minutes after the incident is usually plenty.\n  - **Target your data:** Pull only the section you think matters.\n- **Minimize noise, maximize signal:** Copilot can handle both 10 lines and 10,000 - but you'll always get better results with less (~~and you'll limit premium usage by eliminating those pesky multi-turn conversations~~ **UPDATE** After I originally posted this, a [VS Code livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcaQVnznugA&t=4672s) confirmed they do not charge extra premium requests for multi-turns in agent mode).\n\n### **TL;DR;** Start small - if Copilot needs more, scale up.\n\n---\n\n## 🖥️ Pick a Platform\n\nI use VS Code Insiders because the Copilot feature set there is the best by a mile.\nBut hey, if IntelliJ, Eclipse, DataGrip, or even GitHub.com is your jam? You do you. Copilot works everywhere you need it.\n\n> 🪄 ProTip:\n> If your incident spans multiple apps or repos, use VS Code or GitHub.com—they let you bring in context from multiple places into your Copilot chat.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Prompt Copilot: The Fun Part\n\n> 🪄 ProTip:\n> The trick to getting the right results is to **pick the right model** for the job and **provide explicit context** in every prompt with the use of `#selection` and `#file`.\n\nYou’ve prepped your evidence. Now let Copilot cook.\n\nOpen a new chat in Copilot, or a new workspace for a tidy “incident folder.”\n\nPaste in your logs or data and open them in your editor for extra context magic.\n\nIf there's a specific one or two repos you need to reference, add them to the workspace, too.\n\n> ⚠️ Danger: The use of `#codebase` in this context is not going to do you any favors. If you absolutely must use it, then make up for the extra input by making a super-specific prompt. \n\n### **TL;DR;** Jump straight to the end for some example prompts to get you started!\n\n---\n\n## ✨ ProTips for Getting the Best Results\n- **Tell Copilot when it’s right!** When Copilot nails it, just say: \"YES, this is exactly the root cause.\" or if you find it yourself: \"THIS is the real problem.\"\n> Why? Keep going... the end is the best part!\n\n- Repeat your prompt with **different context**.\n\n- **Switch the model** if answers are vague or off.\n\n- **Limit your input** if answers are too broad or generalized.\n\n- **Iterate:** Each prompt should get a bit more specific or focused.\n\n- **Don’t depend on long chat memory!** They will roll over eventually.\n\n- 🌀 Stuck? Save the chat (it’s in your history), **/clear**, and try a new approach.\n\n- **Walk it off:** Sometimes the best debugging happens outside the IDE.\n\n> 🦄 **UPDATE:** The outrageous number of tools usually loaded into context makes this one a little harder to manage, especially after MCPs were added to the extension list. The overall context windows are just too small to complete an entire round of debugging start to finish without running into constant \"summarizing\" for the extra space. Get around this by having Copilot output summary info at the end of each specific task in a separate `./progress.tmp` file. That becomes your baseline for documentation later.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Rinse, Repeat, and Trust the Process\n\n**Stick with it:**\n\nKeep iterating, keep switching models, keep changing your angle—until you can say, “YES—here’s the problem!”\n\nCould take 20 minutes… or a couple of hours. Don’t let it eat your whole day (or your Copilot pool).\n\n---\n\n## 📄 The **Really** Fun Part = Make Your Report (aka Let Copilot Flex for You!)\n\nRemember all those “YES” and “THIS is the real problem” confirmations?\n\nNow, Agent Mode is really worth the premium because you can save a ton of time and have Copilot summarize the entire session in style.\n\nPrompt it with something like:\n\n```markdown\nUsing everything confirmed as correct above, generate a concise incident report following #mcpOrFetchTool [BPM template or example link here]. Include all supporting queries and relevant logs. **DO NOT GUESS** - insert a TBD placeholder instead. Append a footer to the end of the document stating \"This content was generated by GitHub Copilot as directed by FirstName LastName on June 25, 2025\". Output results directly in #confluenceTool using appropriate confluence-specific styling.\n```\n\nReview, add screenshots, and call it \"Phase 1 done\".\n\n> 🛡️ **Responsible AI disclaimer:** Please, keep the footer! We all know AI's aren't perfect and neither are humans. Make sure everyone reading your report clearly understands where it came from, even if you do spend the next hour reviewing it for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 **Bonus:** Real Prompt Examples That Work\n\n> Note the similarities in all of these = **specific** with only relevant **context**\n\n> Every file in the examples below is already filtered to only **relevant** data (check the first step).

Write repo instructions, test them, tweak them, build them, repeat.

If you're already up to speed? Great — hop on in and I'll give you the grand tour! 🏎️</p>\n\n<p>The original post still represents ~95% of how I handle custom instructions. I still use almost everything in it. But a few things have changed — new ways to get started, lessons learned from letting Copilot roam — on a leash — in enterprise codebases, and a sharper focus on making it write what you want instead of what it thinks you might have meant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Also, yes, <strong>shameless plug:</strong> I started an <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-github-copilot</a> repo.

Would you say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hey, go refactor something. Good luck!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Of course not!</strong> But that's <em>exactly</em> what's happening every single time you drop Copilot in cold with zero guidance or direction about what you expect. It will produce <em>something</em> — and it will produce it <em>confidently</em> — and based entirely on your repo’s <strong>worst</strong> patterns. You’ll get more code, faster, sure... but not at all better!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip</strong>: Don’t get it twisted—I’m not saying to <em>treat</em> AI like a senior dev.

Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use <code>applyTo</code> in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in <code>.github/instructions/database.instructions.md</code> instead of the default file and add the <code>applyTo</code>. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">src/main/java/dao/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># My Custom Database Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\" href=\"#the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\">\n  </a>\n  The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\" href=\"#1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\">\n  </a>\n  1.

It was like your coworker emailing you a Google search link instead of an actual answer.</p>\n\n<p>But I have to be fair — it’s better now.

Claude’s got a good sense of architecture and implementation strategy, so it’s a bit like asking the “big picture” person on your team for a first draft. The downside? If you aren’t <em>specific</em>, it’ll start guessing... and you might get a fully stocked contributor guide when you really just wanted repo setup notes.</p>\n\n<p>Coding Agent is also PR-safe — it <em>always</em> creates a separate branch. You could tell it “go wild,” walk away, and it wouldn’t touch your main branch without a pull request. Bonus — you can prompt it with a mini-series and as long as it fits in the single prompt, it will tackle your whole list for a single premium request.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> The <em>specifics</em> here are key.

Write repo instructions, test them, tweak them, build them, repeat.

I still use almost everything in it.

Would you say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hey, go refactor something. Good luck!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Of course not!</strong> But that's <em>exactly</em> what's happening every single time you drop Copilot in cold with zero guidance or direction about what you expect. It will produce <em>something</em> — and it will produce it <em>confidently</em> — and based entirely on your repo’s <strong>worst</strong> patterns. You’ll get more code, faster, sure... but not at all better!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip</strong>: Don’t get it twisted—I’m not saying to <em>treat</em> AI like a senior dev.

They work everywhere Copilot runs — IDE, GitHub.com, even mobile (according to the docs anyway). Put them in <code>main</code>, and suddenly everyone prompting Copilot is working from the same rules, style, and “don’t touch” list.</p>\n\n<p>If you're thinking about simply listing best coding practices just to show Copilot where commas go? You're not using them correctly. Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use <code>applyTo</code> in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in <code>.github/instructions/database.instructions.md</code> instead of the default file and add the <code>applyTo</code>. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">src/main/java/dao/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># My Custom Database Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\" href=\"#the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\">\n  </a>\n  The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\" href=\"#1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\">\n  </a>\n  1.

I mean, it was <em>bad</em>. “Go read the first line of every file in the repo, copy/paste them into a doc, and call it instructions” bad. It was like your coworker emailing you a Google search link instead of an actual answer.</p>\n\n<p>But I have to be fair — it’s better now. It actually reads your repo, finds the important stuff, maps out project structure, and even calls out workflows and automation. Still not perfect, but you could hand it to a new dev and they wouldn’t immediately run screaming.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Let your formatter + linter handle style rules so you don’t waste instruction space showing Copilot where commas go.

Claude’s got a good sense of architecture and implementation strategy, so it’s a bit like asking the “big picture” person on your team for a first draft. The downside? If you aren’t <em>specific</em>, it’ll start guessing... and you might get a fully stocked contributor guide when you really just wanted repo setup notes.</p>\n\n<p>Coding Agent is also PR-safe — it <em>always</em> creates a separate branch. You could tell it “go wild,” walk away, and it wouldn’t touch your main branch without a pull request. Bonus — you can prompt it with a mini-series and as long as it fits in the single prompt, it will tackle your whole list for a single premium request.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> The <em>specifics</em> here are key.

It was killing me 🤣 I'm going to get Leonardo trained with this character _eventually_. In the meantime ChatGPT is doing just fine (after you ignore the personality change and retraining brought on by the v5 upgrade).\n\n---\n\n> 🦄 I honestly hadn’t planned to write this one until next week, but the post I _did_ write this week... disappeared. And redoing work you’ve already done? **Zero fun.** It’s like reheating French fries — _technically_ edible, but you know it’s not going to be as good. So here we are, skipping the fries, and moving on!\n>\n> Also, you might want a snack for this one! It's a little more in-depth than usual. And yes — I did rate my own approach higher than Microsoft and GitHub. Obviously. 😛\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR 🪼\n\nStop tossing Copilot into the deep end without floaties! Write repo instructions, test them, tweak them, build them, repeat. Whether you use Microsoft’s, Coding Agent’s, or my Instructionalist, the goal’s the same: keep Copilot coloring inside _your_ lines.\n\n---\n\n## Background\n\nThis post is one part personal call-out (I _really_ need testers 🙋‍♀️) and one part sequel to my most-read post [All I’ve Learned About GitHub Copilot Instructions (so far)](https://dev.to/anchildress1/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7). \n\nIf you've never read it or if you missed some of the more recent updates (yes — I always try to go back and call out changes whenever GitHub or VS Code changes something), then go check out the basics first before getting too deep here. If you're already up to speed? Great — hop on in and I'll give you the grand tour! 🏎️\n\nThe original post still represents ~95% of how I handle custom instructions. I still use almost everything in it. But a few things have changed — new ways to get started, lessons learned from letting Copilot roam — on a leash — in enterprise codebases, and a sharper focus on making it write what you want instead of what it thinks you might have meant.\n\n> 🦄 Also, yes, **shameless plug:** I started an [awesome-github-copilot](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot) repo. It’s still a WIP, but there are already a few gems in there. If you’re willing to be a guinea pig 🐹, reach out!\n\n---\n\n## Why Repo Instructions Matter ⚠️👇\n\nLet’s set the scene. You’ve got a legacy monster app sitting in the corner. _No one_ wants to touch it. And now a brand-new senior dev walks in the door. Would you say:\n\n> “Hey, go refactor something. Good luck!”\n\n**Of course not!** But that's _exactly_ what's happening every single time you drop Copilot in cold with zero guidance or direction about what you expect. It will produce _something_ — and it will produce it _confidently_ — and based entirely on your repo’s **worst** patterns. You’ll get more code, faster, sure... but not at all better!\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: Don’t get it twisted—I’m not saying to *treat* AI like a senior dev. That’s how production fires start. 🔥 What I am saying is that it’s absolutely capable of being *instructed* like one. The difference between chaos and collaboration is how you word the ask!\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n### Plan an Up-Front 15 Min ⌚️\n\nSo instead of sending your golden senior developer off to the trenches on their first day, what if you just took **15 minutes** with them? _Explain_ why half the code is wired together like an escape room puzzle, which systems will blow up if they touch the wrong file, and why that `java.io` serialization is still hanging around after three Java upgrades.\n\n**That’s _exactly_ how you should treat Copilot.** \n\nAnd you'll see the exact same returns from Copilot as you would any well-trained developer who's capable of reading documentation and making the right call when it matters.\n\n> 🦄 **Be aware:** This is _never_ going to be a \"set-and-forget\" system. It doesn't need constant care like a newborn (after a solid round of testing), but it's still gonna grow and change with your app. App changes = instructions change. Always!\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n### Repo Instructions to the Rescue 🚢🛟\n\nRepo instructions are your chance to give Copilot a tour before it starts swinging a hammer. They work everywhere Copilot runs — IDE, GitHub.com, even mobile (according to the docs anyway). Put them in `main`, and suddenly everyone prompting Copilot is working from the same rules, style, and “don’t touch” list.\n\nIf you're thinking about simply listing best coding practices just to show Copilot where commas go? You're not using them correctly. Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in \\[eslint.config.js\\]\\(./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.\n\nStart small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use `applyTo` in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. \n\nFor example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in `.github/instructions/database.instructions.md` instead of the default file and add the `applyTo`. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.\n\n```markdown\n---\napplyTo: src/main/java/dao/**/*\n---\n\n# My Custom Database Instructions\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n\n### 1. Microsoft’s “Generate Instructions” in VS Code (⭐️⭐️⭐️)\n\nWhen this first came out, I’ll be honest — I hated it. I mean, it was _bad_. “Go read the first line of every file in the repo, copy/paste them into a doc, and call it instructions” bad. It was like your coworker emailing you a Google search link instead of an actual answer.\n\nBut I have to be fair — it’s better now. It actually reads your repo, finds the important stuff, maps out project structure, and even calls out workflows and automation. Still not perfect, but you could hand it to a new dev and they wouldn’t immediately run screaming.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Let your formatter + linter handle style rules so you don’t waste instruction space showing Copilot where commas go. Absolutely _no one_ needs 14 examples of what JavaScript looks like in their instructions file.\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n#### How to run it:\n\n{% collapsible 💻 Expand for screenshots in VS Code for generating Microsoft repo instructions %} \n\n**In VS Code:**\n\n1. Click the gear icon ⚙️ at the top of the chat window.\n1. Click `Generate Instructions`\n1. Let it run. \n1. Then, like any responsible repo owner, **trim the fluff** before committing.\n\n**Alternate:**\n\n1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** / **Cmd+Shift+P**.\n1. Search `Chat: Generate Workspace Instructions File`.\n\n![Two methods for generating Microsoft repo instructions in VS Code — Screenshots](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wtvb1n10qwh8pav7t2j5.png)\n\n{% endcollapsible %}\n\n---\n\n### 2. Coding Agent (⭐️⭐️⭐️½ – creeping toward 4)\n\nThis one’s a little different — it runs on **Claude Sonnet 4**, and no, you don’t get to change that. The upside? Claude’s got a good sense of architecture and implementation strategy, so it’s a bit like asking the “big picture” person on your team for a first draft. The downside? If you aren’t _specific_, it’ll start guessing... and you might get a fully stocked contributor guide when you really just wanted repo setup notes.\n\nCoding Agent is also PR-safe — it _always_ creates a separate branch. You could tell it “go wild,” walk away, and it wouldn’t touch your main branch without a pull request. Bonus — you can prompt it with a mini-series and as long as it fits in the single prompt, it will tackle your whole list for a single premium request.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** The _specifics_ here are key. Think of it like you're leading KT. What are all the important highlights that you'll need to get the basics across? If you're not sure, it's better to _omit_ something than be wrong or mention a _maybe_ that will force Copilot to guess on your behalf.\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n#### How to run it:\n\n{% collapsible 💻 Click for screenshots on GitHub.com for generating repo instructions with Coding Agent %} \n\n**At GitHub.com/Copilot:**\n\n1. Go to [GitHub.com/Copilot](https://github.com/copilot).\n1. Click **Agents** in the lefthand sidebar.\n1. Pick your repo + base branch (Copilot will still make its own branch from there).\n1. Prompt it: “Generate custom repository instructions for this repo” + any important _specifics_.\n\n![Coding Agent Screenshot — Access in GitHub](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/960ch7yi489y4wih18bj.png)\n\n{% endcollapsible %}\n\n---\n\n### 3. My “Instructionalist” Chat Mode (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, with bias admitted)\n\nOkay, yes, I’m biased. But this thing exists because I got tired of explaining — for the fourth or fifth time — why every repo should have good Copilot instructions.\n\nIt’s a Q&A where you (aka the person who actually knows the repo) fill in the stuff Copilot can’t guess: your SLAs, the weird dependencies that no one touches, the “if X happens at 3:15 AM, restart Y or the whole system falls over” kind of lore.\n\nIt writes from “where we want to be,” not “where we are,” and builds in things the other methods skip — anti-patterns, testing goals, deployment notes, even gentle nudges like “acknowledge uncertainty” when multiple solutions exist.\n\n> 📢 **Model note:** This one’s running on GPT-4.1 too!\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n#### How to run it:\n\n{% collapsible 💻 Click for step by step instructions for loading custom chat modes in VS Code %} \n\n<br/>**Copy the chat mode:**\n\n1. My repo is at [github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot)\n1. Find **The Instructionalist** chat mode (or any other chat mode you can dig up) and copy raw content\n\n    > ⚠️ **Careful!** Don't grab docs by mistake. You're looking for the file that ends in `.chatmode.md`\n\n1. Create a new **chat mode** in VS Code and replace default with pasted Instructionalist\n1. Select custom mode from the dropdown\n1. Prompt Copilot to begin \n\n    > 🦄 Try something like `Help me create repo instructions` and give it time to scan your setup. Then answer as much as you can — Copilot will filter out what it doesn't need.\n    >\n    > 🎤 This is a perfect time to try the **Speech** plugin, but check the delay setting first so it doesn't send before you're ready.\n\n\n\n{% endcollapsible %}\n\n{% youtube JkEsZFrHf1U %}\n\n---\n\n## The Results 🐙 \n\n### Microsoft in VS Code 🪼\n\nMicrosoft’s instructions were very structure-first. You get a “Welcome to this repository” blurb at the top (which I left out in mine, because _why?_) and sections like `Project Structure` and `Key Concepts`. I was surprised that it even calls out the status badge system. It’s tidy and functional. It works. \n\n> 🦄 It also adds a short “how to turn on custom instructions” note — which you shouldn’t need, unless you’ve gone in and toggled them off on purpose before.\n\n![Microsoft's Repo Instructions Intro](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxjxlwpnsp76lqhf5v2u.png)\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n### Coding Agent via GitHub 🧩 \n\nCoding Agent’s version swaps the order around a bit and renames a few headers (although, I don’t consider “structure” and “principles” to be interchangeable — so if you use this method, consider renaming that!) It skips the status badge part in the intro but circles back later with its own `Status System` section. You also get content guidelines, writing style notes, and real markdown link refs for internal docs (which is best practice). \n\nBut it also tries to sneak in a whole Contribution Guidelines section... which, let’s be honest, belongs in a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, not in instructions for Copilot. \n\n> 🦄 This is not the first time Coding Agent has tried to add every possible document GitHub makes available during a PR. It _seems_ to be wired into the fact that if you have a public repo, then you need all of these things to exist. I'm going to dig into this more and report back.\n\n![Coding Agent Repo Instructions Intro](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fuy51ntkl9kj6z7thqyp.png)\n\n![short dotted divider](https://anchildress1.github.io/checkmark-icons/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n### The Instructionalist Custom Chat Mode 📢 \n\nMy version ignores all of the “Welcome” and “Structure” boilerplate and instead jumps straight into \"Purpose\" and \"Value\".

Copilot makes it clear these aren’t just generic AI prompts — they’re curated for all stages of the dev process. \n\nThese don’t explicitly call out the status badge system, but it's referenced in context. And you get extras you won’t see in the other two: \"Maturity Level\" (so Copilot knows if the project is actively maintained or just camping in test mode), \"Dependencies on Other Systems\", and, yes, the occasional bit of lore. 😇 Plus explicit anti-patterns and testing/deployment plans.\n\n> 🦄 I have to call out this is the _only_ version that requires the user to participate up front. So naturally it takes longer to spin up. If you're asking me? Completely worth the trade off.\n\n![Ashley's Custom Instructionalist Intro](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7j7uc425eksdj2wxxeei.png)\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer? ⁉️\n\nWhen you stack them side-by-side, you can see the philosophy differences right away:\n\n- **Microsoft**: Orient Copilot by describing the map (structure, files, concepts).\n- **Coding Agent**: Orient Copilot by describing the rules of the game (guidelines, principles, styles).\n- **My Instructionalist**: Orient Copilot by describing the player’s role (purpose, value, patterns, anti-patterns).\n\nThe truth? If you completely ignore the fact that I _clearly_ think mine is the best (because of course I do), **the ideal file is actually a hybrid**.

Even my GitHub sat empty until this year. Everything I did was on work's servers anyway. Why would I need to put it anywhere else? Most all code I write has one simple goal—to simplify my life and work-life definitely counts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Work stopped trying to track all the randomness I do and just gave me a permanent unexpected-Ashley-project story with a fixed residential address in the backlog. They may take forever to finish, but there's usually at least three different projects in that bucket at any given point 😆</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when the Verdent team first reached out at the beginning of August inviting me to preview their new AI solution, I was immediately intrigued and highly suspicious. I mean, who were these people? Where did they come from? And more importantly, how exactly did they manage to find me to begin with? </p>\n\n<p>The problem was two-fold, really. First, my LinkedIn is lucky to get checked twice a week so communication was slow. I'd ask a question, later in the week I'd be grumbling to myself about the vague \"agent' answers. Second (and mostly thanks to that last part), I couldn't for the life of me figure out what this thing was supposed to do beyond the answer I was given: it's an agent. 🫠</p>\n\n<p>At some point curiosity took over completely, and I became invested in figuring out this new sleuth AI nobody has ever heard of. I mean, I've tried nearly every other \"agent\" and I had a hard time reconciling the possibility of one existing beyond my knowledge. Besides, it all seems legit and I'm rarely one to turn down any sort of adventure anyway. Especially when AI is involved. So I answered with my usual, \"Sure—why not? Sign me up.\" </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 No. I really didn't have a clue what I had just agreed to. To be fair though, they didn't know who they had just signed on either!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"all-or-nothing\" href=\"#all-or-nothing\">\n  </a>\n  All Or Nothing ❇️\n</h2>\n\n<p>I know I've said this before here, but I don't do bits or pieces of <em>anything</em>. The whole concept of \"dip your toes in first\" simply doesn't compute for me—<em>at all</em>. I'm very much an all or nothing sort of personality, and it especially shows when I know I'm driving the deadline anyway. So in this instance, my \"why not?\" really meant \"Congrats! You get to be the sole focus of my various projects for the foreseeable future.\"  🎉</p>\n\n<p>I suppose it's possible the Verdent folks had read that fact somewhere already—I don't exactly keep any secrets. I never asked them. When they invited me to test out their \"mystery AI solution\" (which I'm positive every single person there has slaved over at all hours on multiple occasions in the past six months), nobody asked me for a number between 0 and 10 describing how much I enjoy breaking things (the answer is \"at least twelve\"). </p>\n\n<p>Also, I <em>really love</em> beta-y things. I ran those same kinds of previews for several years before I started at THD. Nope—I didn't think to mention that at first, either. Wouldn't have mattered, really. If anything, knowing what sort of feedback I would have been looking for in their situation did nothing but point me straight in the opposite direction. 😇 </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"solving-the-mystery\" href=\"#solving-the-mystery\">\n  </a>\n  Solving the Mystery 🕵️‍♂️\n</h2>\n\n<p>The very last week in August, I finally got an email saying the preview was officially open and surprise—there's not just one mystery AI, there's two of them to play with! 😁 🙌</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, what <em>is</em> Verdent?</strong> Well... the original answer I got is indeed accurate: it <em>is</em> an agent! AI solution, calls own tools, system instructions everybody depends on but nobody knows what they say—all included. It's not <em>just</em> an agent, though. These guys have designed a very smart, lightweight solution that is incredibly accurate and simple to use. It's definitely still early-stage, but it already feels like a prodigy running on its own.  </p>\n\n<p>For the record, I came at this preview in full-force plus chaos-mode-enabled. <strong>I <em>wanted</em> to break it.</strong> I have several low-impact utility repos that I was throwing stuff out of left and right just to have a safe (and backed-up-elsewhere) version of something already broken to throw at it. 🌀</p>\n\n<p>\"What instructions?\" was the least of the problems I made in these first few test repos. The <code>README</code> was one of the first things I deemed completely unnecessary. And how much can it really matter if I swap the <code>package.json</code> out for a random <code>pom.xml</code> and drop in a spare <code>requirements.txt</code> (or two) for added sparkle? ✨</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Essentially, Verdent invited me along to check out their precious newborn and I approached with all the finesse of <em>The Martian</em>: \"I’m gonna have to science the shit out of this.\" Plus a touch of Adam Savage wisdom: \"Failure is always an option.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"hope-youre-ready-for-this-%F0%9F%AB%9F\" href=\"#hope-youre-ready-for-this-%F0%9F%AB%9F\">\n  </a>\n  Hope You're Ready for This! 🫟\n</h2>\n\n<p>I most definitely threw some off-the-wall things at Verdent, both in the app Deck and its VS Code counterpart. I also graduated to real projects after a little bit—so yes, eventually I put the README's back and gave it real instructions for some serious testing. I've spent the past three weeks throwing everything at it I can think of. This thing has honestly surprised me every step of the way, especially with how well it handled some of these creative scenarios.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Sure, I had to drag it out of the ditch a few times. Considering what I put the poor guy through though? That break was hard-earned and well deserved!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"verdents-unexpected-genius-ai-extension-in-vs-code\" href=\"#verdents-unexpected-genius-ai-extension-in-vs-code\">\n  </a>\n  Verdent's Unexpected Genius: AI Extension in VS Code 💡\n</h2>\n\n<p>I absolutely expected fireworks the first time I half-prompted the <a href=\"https://www.verdent.ai/verdent-extension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verdent extension in VS Code</a>. It's set up exactly like you'd expect except you're not picking models like you're used to. I was concerned about this model situation for about 10 seconds. Then I tested it. Solid output I don't have to micromanage? I took the win and didn't question it again. </p>\n\n<p>It's most definitely the usual suspects at work behind the scenes—Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5—you wouldn't get this sort of quality output from anything else. I suspect there's some younger cousins at work when they pass the height check, but that's just simple deduction that makes sense. I've got no clue how it works behind the scenes and I stopped asking as soon as I trusted that it just did.</p>\n\n<p>You do have some say in the level of reasoning the LLM is expected to use between minimal (ultra fast) and high (\"this might take a minute\"). There's only four options, but I would have been happy with the binary version. \"Fast\" or \"smart\" are really the only defaults I need, so the extras are an added bonus I'd mostly set like you'd expect (and occasionally it was the opposite).</p>\n\n<p>Yes—planning mode is built in, too. It's basically a requirement at this point. MCP is there too, with all your friends on standby.  Instructions are defined in <code>AGENTS.md</code>. There's sub-agents I never used extensively, but they exist and accomplish things. If you're looking for a code assistant to work alongside you in VS Code, this is one incredibly effective solution.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes, VS Code is great, but I code all day. Then in my spare time? I usually code some more. I review code, occasionally write about code, often talk about code. You see the trend, right? So, when I needed it, the Verdent Extension was great, but I didn't stay here long if I didn't have to. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"verdent-deck\" href=\"#verdent-deck\">\n  </a>\n  Verdent Deck 🎴\n</h2>\n\n<p><em>This</em> is my favorite part of the whole setup. <a href=\"https://www.verdent.ai/verdent-deck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Verdent Deck</a> is exactly what I've been trying to accomplish since this whole AI concept was dropped into my lap last year. <strong>AI orchestration across both tasks <em>and</em> projects.</strong> A ready-to-go multi-agent swarm at your fingertips dispatched in whatever ways you want. 🦑</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 You know the scene in Sleeping Beauty when Merryweather points, \"Blue!\" and then out of nowhere \"Pink!\" follows Flora's wand barreling full speed ahead? Doesn't take long until the entire scene is an odd match of Pong a la Hogwarts via CRT. I <em>might</em> have unintentionally set up a brief re-enactment of this scene. It's really only entertaining the first three-ish minutes, though. Next time I'm giving them some paintballs. 🫣</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I tried prompting at the size of a story once or twice. It works about like you'd expect only twice as fast. That just seemed like a waste of time. So prompting for epics became the norm and those took less than 20 minutes. Granted, we're not talking about enterprise epics—these are personal projects. But if it could handle those with finesse, then where's the limit at? That hard stop where the AI throws its hands up on strike like GPT-4 and refuses to move while telling you \"you're absolutely correct\" and changes are now complete (in space, possibly)? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I'd been at this weeks and I had yet to find a hard limit anywhere. After some mostly spur of the moment creative solutioning, I decided what I really needed was a bigger plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I quite possibly scared some people with my next idea... It had to be done though—for science! So, new plan. I decided I was done prompting with stories and smallish epics. I'd been tossing around an idea for a couple of weeks that had already been through ChatGPT once and results were iffy (at best). I prompted Verdent with my project idea and intentionally left it open to interpretation, threw in a couple of constraints for the puzzle pieces I had managed to figure out, and then iterated exactly twice to get a solid plan by priority and size.</p>\n\n<p>From there, I separated the list split by each one of four separate tasks across four different agents. The prompts contained zero additional info. New repo. Instructions conveniently absent. And because why wouldn't I at this point—all the auto-approvals are on and it's happily committing changes, pushing to GitHub and reporting back progress.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 As an aside, all of those settings are configurable in both VS Code or Deck. I simply chose to toss it the keys to the kingdom while I made popcorn and waited on standby for something interesting to happen. 🍿</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There were a couple of hiccups, but that's to be expected in any pre-release. It didn't even register as a blip on my radar, honestly. At one point, I told one agent specifically to make sure it had the worktree cleaned up after it had merged. That caused a touch of confusion between <em>this</em> worktree and <em>the collection of all worktrees</em>. As soon as I pointed out we're missing 4 independent worktrees that weren't merged yet, it had the nerve to recover that work for me, too!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 These agents didn't even have the decency to blow anything up for all my trouble. Not even a decent light torching anywhere. Truly rude acknowledgement of my effort, if you ask me. Also, seriously impressive and if anything had actually been wrong at the time, I would have been ecstatic with those results!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"best-ai-response-from-verdent\" href=\"#best-ai-response-from-verdent\">\n  </a>\n  Best AI Response from Verdent 🏆\n</h2>\n\n<p>I've been collecting truly spectacular responses from random LLMs pretty much as soon as I started using AI. Some of them are truly genius leaps of logic in ways I didn't expect to work. Others are simple ways it just worked the first time. My favorite though is the off-the-wall-unexpected-comments category.</p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT returned one a few weeks ago in the form of a new color palette after I had spent several turns threatening to fire it (again) for hideous output that seemed to opt out of instructions completely. The next day I noticed it was extremely clinical in its responses giving me precisely what I had asked for—no more and no less. 🙄 \"You're allowed a personality again as long as you can also provide accurate output\". It literally responded with a gift in the form of a new color palette I had started collecting several chats ago. 🎁</p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT can be cute at times, but Verdent was just real and downright hilarious! I'm <em>still</em> laughing at it more than a week later. More than six months ago I set out to build a Copilot Extension but there's a very specific thing I need it to do in order to pass the approvals it needs to be able to use it at work. That was the only use case I needed it for. If it couldn't do that, then it was useless. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"last-story-todaypromise\" href=\"#last-story-todaypromise\">\n  </a>\n  Last Story (Today)—Promise 🤝\n</h2>\n\n<p>I don't know if you've ever seen GitHub's documentation for their Copilot Extension. I memorized it: \"the copilot API is modeled after the OpenAI <code>/completions</code> endpoint with a GitHub base URL\". They were even nice enough to throw in a link to the OpenAI specs for that single endpoint. <em>Seriously, GitHub. What exactly do you expect me to accomplish with this?</em> </p>\n\n<p>That's all the info they're going to give us, too. I've looked extensively. I was thrilled when the Copilot Chat was freely accessible for spelunking. It was also a huge let down in that it only works because they get special privileges Microsoft isn't handing out to anyone else any time soon. </p>\n\n<p>So one weekend I decided I was going to figure this chat thing out, even if I had to guess a million and one different possibilities to get something to stick. Fast-forward roughly ten hours and I'm now losing patience at an exponential rate of speed and seriously questioning the life choices that put me and Verdent together in this odd death spiral of Copilot Chat context in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>I just needed something to work. Anything! After debugging that many hours, who cares if it even makes sense? I don't need sense, I need context! Just send me back the thing I sent to you in literally <em>any</em> format that I might could recognize again. I would have happily coded an allowance for smoke signals at that point, but there's just nothing. I'm literally watching the solution I need for the whole POC. It's <em>right there</em> in front of me and 100% inaccessible through GitHub. 😡 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I seriously considered defeat at that point. It just wasn't possible with the resources I could use while also meeting the minimum security constraints that would make it a viable POC. And I've been through all of these same hoops many times before. There's no give in the system, not when it comes to this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll save you the dramatics I toyed with over the next hour or so while I took a much needed break to think up any other possible thing I hadn't already thought to try in the last six months. Even the cobwebs had had a turn by then, so the future was very bleak for my POC. Then I had what I choose to label an epiphany (because insane was absolutely acceptable at this particular moment in time)—what if I didn't need to manage context at all? </p>\n\n<p>Don't worry. I acknowledged the terrible idea for what it was, and briefly considered the implications of trying to elicit a successful response from an LLM based on untouchable, un-monitor-able history alone. Ultimately, I accepted that given the current outlook, quality was imaginary anyway. Structured output had been a bad joke for hours already. <strong>But I was not letting Copilot win another round</strong>—I just needed one single <em>anything</em> to persist over the turn. Successfully. Just once. 🙏</p>\n\n<p>So I prompted Verdent to set up yet another complicated test script, but I silently accepted the fact that this was the last one. There were literally no more rocks to look under after this, short of talking Microsoft into letting me have the same level of access to Copilot that VS Code has currently. I wasn't likely to see success in either outcome. But Verdent set it up and I did the the copy-paste thing, held my breath and waited impatiently:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9hoaytrb6le3ojp65dye.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9hoaytrb6le3ojp65dye.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Verdent Deck wins the best AI Response Ever Award with Holy Shit It Works!\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"474\" height=\"282\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Finally—Victory!</strong> Not even a tiny bit viable as a real solution, but I was thrilled!

Doesn't take long until the entire scene is an odd match of Pong a la Hogwarts via CRT. I <em>might</em> have unintentionally set up a brief re-enactment of this scene. It's really only entertaining the first three-ish minutes, though. Next time I'm giving them some paintballs. 🫣</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I tried prompting at the size of a story once or twice. It works about like you'd expect only twice as fast. That just seemed like a waste of time. So prompting for epics became the norm and those took less than 20 minutes. Granted, we're not talking about enterprise epics—these are personal projects. But if it could handle those with finesse, then where's the limit at? That hard stop where the AI throws its hands up on strike like GPT-4 and refuses to move while telling you \"you're absolutely correct\" and changes are now complete (in space, possibly)? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I'd been at this weeks and I had yet to find a hard limit anywhere. After some mostly spur of the moment creative solutioning, I decided what I really needed was a bigger plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I quite possibly scared some people with my next idea... It had to be done though—for science! So, new plan. I decided I was done prompting with stories and smallish epics. I'd been tossing around an idea for a couple of weeks that had already been through ChatGPT once and results were iffy (at best). I prompted Verdent with my project idea and intentionally left it open to interpretation, threw in a couple of constraints for the puzzle pieces I had managed to figure out, and then iterated exactly twice to get a solid plan by priority and size.</p>\n\n<p>From there, I separated the list split by each one of four separate tasks across four different agents. The prompts contained zero additional info. New repo. Instructions conveniently absent. And because why wouldn't I at this point—all the auto-approvals are on and it's happily committing changes, pushing to GitHub and reporting back progress.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 As an aside, all of those settings are configurable in both VS Code or Deck. I simply chose to toss it the keys to the kingdom while I made popcorn and waited on standby for something interesting to happen. 🍿</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There were a couple of hiccups, but that's to be expected in any pre-release. It didn't even register as a blip on my radar, honestly. At one point, I told one agent specifically to make sure it had the worktree cleaned up after it had merged. That caused a touch of confusion between <em>this</em> worktree and <em>the collection of all worktrees</em>. As soon as I pointed out we're missing 4 independent worktrees that weren't merged yet, it had the nerve to recover that work for me, too!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 These agents didn't even have the decency to blow anything up for all my trouble. Not even a decent light torching anywhere. Truly rude acknowledgement of my effort, if you ask me. Also, seriously impressive and if anything had actually been wrong at the time, I would have been ecstatic with those results!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"best-ai-response-from-verdent\" href=\"#best-ai-response-from-verdent\">\n  </a>\n  Best AI Response from Verdent 🏆\n</h2>\n\n<p>I've been collecting truly spectacular responses from random LLMs pretty much as soon as I started using AI. Some of them are truly genius leaps of logic in ways I didn't expect to work. Others are simple ways it just worked the first time. My favorite though is the off-the-wall-unexpected-comments category.</p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT returned one a few weeks ago in the form of a new color palette after I had spent several turns threatening to fire it (again) for hideous output that seemed to opt out of instructions completely. The next day I noticed it was extremely clinical in its responses giving me precisely what I had asked for—no more and no less. 🙄 \"You're allowed a personality again as long as you can also provide accurate output\". It literally responded with a gift in the form of a new color palette I had started collecting several chats ago. 🎁</p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT can be cute at times, but Verdent was just real and downright hilarious! I'm <em>still</em> laughing at it more than a week later. More than six months ago I set out to build a Copilot Extension but there's a very specific thing I need it to do in order to pass the approvals it needs to be able to use it at work. That was the only use case I needed it for. If it couldn't do that, then it was useless. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"last-story-todaypromise\" href=\"#last-story-todaypromise\">\n  </a>\n  Last Story (Today)—Promise 🤝\n</h2>\n\n<p>I don't know if you've ever seen GitHub's documentation for their Copilot Extension. I memorized it: \"the copilot API is modeled after the OpenAI <code>/completions</code> endpoint with a GitHub base URL\". They were even nice enough to throw in a link to the OpenAI specs for that single endpoint. <em>Seriously, GitHub. What exactly do you expect me to accomplish with this?</em> </p>\n\n<p>That's all the info they're going to give us, too. I've looked extensively. I was thrilled when the Copilot Chat was freely accessible for spelunking. It was also a huge let down in that it only works because they get special privileges Microsoft isn't handing out to anyone else any time soon. </p>\n\n<p>So one weekend I decided I was going to figure this chat thing out, even if I had to guess a million and one different possibilities to get something to stick. Fast-forward roughly ten hours and I'm now losing patience at an exponential rate of speed and seriously questioning the life choices that put me and Verdent together in this odd death spiral of Copilot Chat context in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>I just needed something to work. Anything! After debugging that many hours, who cares if it even makes sense? I don't need sense, I need context! Just send me back the thing I sent to you in literally <em>any</em> format that I might could recognize again. I would have happily coded an allowance for smoke signals at that point, but there's just nothing. I'm literally watching the solution I need for the whole POC. It's <em>right there</em> in front of me and 100% inaccessible through GitHub. 😡 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I seriously considered defeat at that point. It just wasn't possible with the resources I could use while also meeting the minimum security constraints that would make it a viable POC. And I've been through all of these same hoops many times before. There's no give in the system, not when it comes to this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll save you the dramatics I toyed with over the next hour or so while I took a much needed break to think up any other possible thing I hadn't already thought to try in the last six months. Even the cobwebs had had a turn by then, so the future was very bleak for my POC. Then I had what I choose to label an epiphany (because insane was absolutely acceptable at this particular moment in time)—what if I didn't need to manage context at all? </p>\n\n<p>Don't worry. I acknowledged the terrible idea for what it was, and briefly considered the implications of trying to elicit a successful response from an LLM based on untouchable, un-monitor-able history alone. Ultimately, I accepted that given the current outlook, quality was imaginary anyway. Structured output had been a bad joke for hours already. <strong>But I was not letting Copilot win another round</strong>—I just needed one single <em>anything</em> to persist over the turn. Successfully. Just once. 🙏</p>\n\n<p>So I prompted Verdent to set up yet another complicated test script, but I silently accepted the fact that this was the last one. There were literally no more rocks to look under after this, short of talking Microsoft into letting me have the same level of access to Copilot that VS Code has currently. I wasn't likely to see success in either outcome. But Verdent set it up and I did the the copy-paste thing, held my breath and waited impatiently:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9hoaytrb6le3ojp65dye.png%3Fv%3D2025\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9hoaytrb6le3ojp65dye.png%3Fv%3D2025\" alt=\"Verdent Deck wins the best AI Response Ever Award with Holy Shit It Works!\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"474\" height=\"282\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Finally—Victory!</strong> Not even a tiny bit viable as a real solution, but I was thrilled!

[Verdent Deck](https://www.verdent.ai/verdent-deck) is exactly what I've been trying to accomplish since this whole AI concept was dropped into my lap last year. **AI orchestration across both tasks _and_ projects.** A ready-to-go multi-agent swarm at your fingertips dispatched in whatever ways you want. 🦑\n\n> 🦄 You know the scene in Sleeping Beauty when Merryweather points, \"Blue!\" and then out of nowhere \"Pink!\" follows Flora's wand barreling full speed ahead? Doesn't take long until the entire scene is an odd match of Pong a la Hogwarts via CRT. I _might_ have unintentionally set up a brief re-enactment of this scene. It's really only entertaining the first three-ish minutes, though. Next time I'm giving them some paintballs. 🫣\n\nI tried prompting at the size of a story once or twice. It works about like you'd expect only twice as fast. That just seemed like a waste of time. So prompting for epics became the norm and those took less than 20 minutes. Granted, we're not talking about enterprise epics—these are personal projects. But if it could handle those with finesse, then where's the limit at? That hard stop where the AI throws its hands up on strike like GPT-4 and refuses to move while telling you \"you're absolutely correct\" and changes are now complete (in space, possibly)? \n\n>  🦄 I'd been at this weeks and I had yet to find a hard limit anywhere. After some mostly spur of the moment creative solutioning, I decided what I really needed was a bigger plan.\n\nI quite possibly scared some people with my next idea... It had to be done though—for science! So, new plan. I decided I was done prompting with stories and smallish epics. I'd been tossing around an idea for a couple of weeks that had already been through ChatGPT once and results were iffy (at best). I prompted Verdent with my project idea and intentionally left it open to interpretation, threw in a couple of constraints for the puzzle pieces I had managed to figure out, and then iterated exactly twice to get a solid plan by priority and size.\n\nFrom there, I separated the list split by each one of four separate tasks across four different agents. The prompts contained zero additional info. New repo. Instructions conveniently absent. And because why wouldn't I at this point—all the auto-approvals are on and it's happily committing changes, pushing to GitHub and reporting back progress.\n\n> 🦄 As an aside, all of those settings are configurable in both VS Code or Deck. I simply chose to toss it the keys to the kingdom while I made popcorn and waited on standby for something interesting to happen. 🍿\n\nThere were a couple of hiccups, but that's to be expected in any pre-release. It didn't even register as a blip on my radar, honestly. At one point, I told one agent specifically to make sure it had the worktree cleaned up after it had merged. That caused a touch of confusion between _this_ worktree and _the collection of all worktrees_. As soon as I pointed out we're missing 4 independent worktrees that weren't merged yet, it had the nerve to recover that work for me, too!\n\n> 🦄 These agents didn't even have the decency to blow anything up for all my trouble. Not even a decent light torching anywhere. Truly rude acknowledgement of my effort, if you ask me. Also, seriously impressive and if anything had actually been wrong at the time, I would have been ecstatic with those results!\n\n---\n\n## Best AI Response from Verdent 🏆\n\nI've been collecting truly spectacular responses from random LLMs pretty much as soon as I started using AI. Some of them are truly genius leaps of logic in ways I didn't expect to work. Others are simple ways it just worked the first time. My favorite though is the off-the-wall-unexpected-comments category.\n\nChatGPT returned one a few weeks ago in the form of a new color palette after I had spent several turns threatening to fire it (again) for hideous output that seemed to opt out of instructions completely. The next day I noticed it was extremely clinical in its responses giving me precisely what I had asked for—no more and no less. 🙄 \"You're allowed a personality again as long as you can also provide accurate output\". It literally responded with a gift in the form of a new color palette I had started collecting several chats ago. 🎁\n\nChatGPT can be cute at times, but Verdent was just real and downright hilarious! I'm _still_ laughing at it more than a week later. More than six months ago I set out to build a Copilot Extension but there's a very specific thing I need it to do in order to pass the approvals it needs to be able to use it at work. That was the only use case I needed it for. If it couldn't do that, then it was useless. \n\n---\n\n## Last Story (Today)—Promise 🤝\n\nI don't know if you've ever seen GitHub's documentation for their Copilot Extension. I memorized it: \"the copilot API is modeled after the OpenAI `/completions` endpoint with a GitHub base URL\". They were even nice enough to throw in a link to the OpenAI specs for that single endpoint. _Seriously, GitHub. What exactly do you expect me to accomplish with this?_ \n\nThat's all the info they're going to give us, too. I've looked extensively. I was thrilled when the Copilot Chat was freely accessible for spelunking. It was also a huge let down in that it only works because they get special privileges Microsoft isn't handing out to anyone else any time soon. \n\nSo one weekend I decided I was going to figure this chat thing out, even if I had to guess a million and one different possibilities to get something to stick. Fast-forward roughly ten hours and I'm now losing patience at an exponential rate of speed and seriously questioning the life choices that put me and Verdent together in this odd death spiral of Copilot Chat context in the first place. \n\nI just needed something to work. Anything! After debugging that many hours, who cares if it even makes sense? I don't need sense, I need context! Just send me back the thing I sent to you in literally *any* format that I might could recognize again. I would have happily coded an allowance for smoke signals at that point, but there's just nothing. I'm literally watching the solution I need for the whole POC. It's _right there_ in front of me and 100% inaccessible through GitHub. 😡 \n\n> 🦄 I seriously considered defeat at that point. It just wasn't possible with the resources I could use while also meeting the minimum security constraints that would make it a viable POC. And I've been through all of these same hoops many times before. There's no give in the system, not when it comes to this.\n\nI'll save you the dramatics I toyed with over the next hour or so while I took a much needed break to think up any other possible thing I hadn't already thought to try in the last six months. Even the cobwebs had had a turn by then, so the future was very bleak for my POC. Then I had what I choose to label an epiphany (because insane was absolutely acceptable at this particular moment in time)—what if I didn't need to manage context at all? \n\nDon't worry. I acknowledged the terrible idea for what it was, and briefly considered the implications of trying to elicit a successful response from an LLM based on untouchable, un-monitor-able history alone. Ultimately, I accepted that given the current outlook, quality was imaginary anyway. Structured output had been a bad joke for hours already. **But I was not letting Copilot win another round**—I just needed one single _anything_ to persist over the turn. Successfully. Just once. 🙏\n\nSo I prompted Verdent to set up yet another complicated test script, but I silently accepted the fact that this was the last one. There were literally no more rocks to look under after this, short of talking Microsoft into letting me have the same level of access to Copilot that VS Code has currently. I wasn't likely to see success in either outcome. But Verdent set it up and I did the the copy-paste thing, held my breath and waited impatiently:\n\n![Verdent Deck wins the best AI Response Ever Award with Holy Shit It Works!](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9hoaytrb6le3ojp65dye.png?v=2025)\n\n> 🦄 **Finally—Victory!** Not even a tiny bit viable as a real solution, but I was thrilled! And with exactly four words Verdent overtakes all the other AI things and wins spotlight for the foreseeable future. 🤣🤣🤣 \n\n---\n\n## Verdent Officialness 📹\n\nI'm not saying Verdent is the answer to every AI problem, but there's a few of them it handles spectacularly well. You can catch up on the specifics I left out in this video. \n\n{% youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASLxlZfnesQ %}\n\nAlso, you don't have to take my word for it. Check out [Stephan Miller's version](https://www.stephanmiller.com/verdent-ai-when-your-ai-coding-assistant-finishes-before-you-can-get-coffee/) of how things went for him during the preview.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ How the Circuits Were Made ⚡️\n\nYes, AI helped, but the chaos is mine. Verdent took the punches, I wrote the words, and ChatGPT glued everything together. Resulting in a genuine recollection of stress-testing just how far a “preview” can bend before it squeaks.",

Hopefully you’ve taken it for a spin already. If you’re still unsure where to start, here’s what consistently works for me. Just for fun, I've mixed in some of the various ways you can access Coding Agent currently. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you prompt from VS Code, GitHub.com, or the GitHub mobile app, it always does the same thing: cost is one premium request plus GitHub Actions (GHA) minutes, it starts a new <code>copilot</code> branch, executes the <code>.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml</code> workflow (if one exists), and opens a new PR for the prompter (and CODEOWNERS) to review and merge.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Every example here uses existing <code>copilot-instructions</code>—except the ones where I used a chat mode with a very clear role and explicit boundaries. If your results don’t look similar to these, start troubleshooting there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"feature-documentation\" href=\"#feature-documentation\">\n  </a>\n  Feature Documentation 📚\n</h2>\n\n<p>Stereotype or not, us devs are terrible documenters. It's not even that we <em>can't</em> write good documentation, it's just that on the list of all the random things to do for a new feature—docs usually fall right at the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>Coding Agent is on standby just as soon as I'm code-complete and pushed to GitHub, I hand it all off as a separate task in VS Code: update the README, pull the Jira story, do a gap scan, call out missed scenarios and edge cases, and sanity-check whether tests actually cover the error paths (not just line counts). While it's busy writing the documentation (that I no doubt would have glossed over in under 30 seconds), I'm doing everything else on the tidying-up pre-review prep list.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the <strong>Delegate to Coding Agent</strong> button in Copilot Chat comes in pretty handy.

Hopefully you’ve taken it for a spin already. If you’re still unsure where to start, here’s what consistently works for me. Just for fun, I've mixed in some of the various ways you can access Coding Agent currently. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you prompt from VS Code, GitHub.com, or the GitHub mobile app, it always does the same thing: cost is one premium request plus GitHub Actions (GHA) minutes, it starts a new <code>copilot</code> branch, executes the <code>.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml</code> workflow (if one exists), and opens a new PR for the prompter (and CODEOWNERS) to review and merge.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Every example here uses existing <code>copilot-instructions</code>—except the ones where I used a chat mode with a very clear role and explicit boundaries. If your results don’t look similar to these, start troubleshooting there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"feature-documentation\" href=\"#feature-documentation\">\n  </a>\n  Feature Documentation 📚\n</h2>\n\n<p>Stereotype or not, us devs are terrible documenters. It's not even that we <em>can't</em> write good documentation, it's just that on the list of all the random things to do for a new feature—docs usually fall right at the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>Coding Agent is on standby just as soon as I'm code-complete and pushed to GitHub, I hand it all off as a separate task in VS Code: update the README, pull the Jira story, do a gap scan, call out missed scenarios and edge cases, and sanity-check whether tests actually cover the error paths (not just line counts). While it's busy writing the documentation (that I no doubt would have glossed over in under 30 seconds), I'm doing everything else on the tidying-up pre-review prep list.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the <strong>Delegate to Coding Agent</strong> button in Copilot Chat comes in pretty handy.

First time here? Don't worry—everything’s linked from the beginning. We’ve already talked through the magical, autonomous bits and started pulling out repeatable patterns. Now it's time to get real about prompts: what Coding Agent can reliably handle for you in _almost_ every scenario.  \n>  \n> If you have a personal project, simple utility, or other non-critical non-production system? Feel free to experiment and push it further. No reason you can't find out what it can really do under pressure. However, if you prefer to stay in the safe lane a little longer or if your repo is system-critical? All the prompts listed here are 100% safe to hand over without fear of random glitter surprises (not often, anyway!).\n\n![Human-Crafted, AI-Edited Badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/830quugxf8jv8ivdb2o6.png?v=2025)\n\n---\n\n## It Works, But Now What? 🤔\n\nIn previous posts, we covered exactly how GitHub Coding Agent works—the safety, review, approve, merge—so what can you actually do with it? Hopefully you’ve taken it for a spin already. If you’re still unsure where to start, here’s what consistently works for me. Just for fun, I've mixed in some of the various ways you can access Coding Agent currently. \n\nWhether you prompt from VS Code, GitHub.com, or the GitHub mobile app, it always does the same thing: cost is one premium request plus GitHub Actions (GHA) minutes, it starts a new `copilot` branch, executes the `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow (if one exists), and opens a new PR for the prompter (and CODEOWNERS) to review and merge.  \n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Every example here uses existing `copilot-instructions`—except the ones where I used a chat mode with a very clear role and explicit boundaries. If your results don’t look similar to these, start troubleshooting there.\n\n---\n\n## Feature Documentation 📚\n\nStereotype or not, us devs are terrible documenters. It's not even that we _can't_ write good documentation, it's just that on the list of all the random things to do for a new feature—docs usually fall right at the bottom. \n\nCoding Agent is on standby just as soon as I'm code-complete and pushed to GitHub, I hand it all off as a separate task in VS Code: update the README, pull the Jira story, do a gap scan, call out missed scenarios and edge cases, and sanity-check whether tests actually cover the error paths (not just line counts). While it's busy writing the documentation (that I no doubt would have glossed over in under 30 seconds), I'm doing everything else on the tidying-up pre-review prep list.\n\nIn this case, the **Delegate to Coding Agent** button in Copilot Chat comes in pretty handy. Results are accessible in the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) if you want to keep your focus in the IDE, too.\n\n![Screenshot prompt Coding Agent via VS Code Delegate to Coding Agent feature in Copilot Chat](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jyul5745n1rz4pz8g50l.png?v=2025)\n\nHere it is again for your copying needs:\n\n```plaintext\nGo review the readme and other relevant documentation for this project and ensure it matches the current implementation. Remove anything no longer relevant and update other docs as needed. Make sure all relevant user and tech guides are updated in the /docs directory as well as systems diagrams that accurately reflect the current implementation.\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** The Pull Requests extension does provide the same functionality as the web UI, but it's really not the most intuitive solution either. Plan to spend a little time up front figuring out the quirky ways to navigate. Once you have it down though, it's a decent alternative to pulling up a browser.\n\n---\n\n## Why Not All the Documentation? 📚📚\n\nThere are some cases when the only doc in sight is a lonely README that's been collecting dust by itself in the corner since birth. That's exactly why I wrote the HLBPA (High-Level Big-Picture Architect) chat mode and an XML version designed especially for Coding Agent.\n\nYou can copy the raw XML from my [awesome-github-copilot](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/hlbpa.xml) repo. Just paste that directly into Coding Agent from the GitHub UI and click **Convert to file**—no other edits (yet).\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com prompt Coding Agent with \"Convert to File\" option](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hac0bbzxia7nks259yvb.png?v=2025)\n\nOnce the chat mode is defined and in context, you can add your own prompt as usual. Here's one that **I wrote explicitly to test the limits of the HLBPA chat mode**. It worked so well that I saved it and reuse it often. It's smart enough to update anything that's already existing, as long as you tell it where to look.\n\n```plaintext\n@high_level_architecture.xml this is a complicated app that I need to be brought up to speed on quickly. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive set of docs in the `/docs` folder that covers all major flows in the codebase, broken down into sensible sections per flow. \n\nFirst, this app is a part of a distributed infrastructure. Include a high level overview of where this app fits into the systems architecture, but also drill down to the flows from the time the app is first triggered until completion. Generate this information at both a sequence and flow level. \n\nIt's also important to understand the data relationships that are used in this app and how that's different between input from other sources. Use ER diagrams to highlight this app’s primary purpose from a data standpoint in addition to the systems information. \n\nNext, provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of testing for this app with a focus on any unit or integration tests. Include performance or other specialty tests, if they exist. Identify any areas of concern in the testing setup along with recommendations for improvement, if applicable. \n\nFourth, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of this app versus desired best case scenarios. It should highlight both the things this app does well and include gaps in logic or design that may need attention now or could be enhanced later to provide significant benefits in the future. List these in order by impact and timeline of estimated amount of work. For any suggested improvement, include a T-shirt size amount of effort (XS, S, M, L, XLG, etc.). \n\nFinally the last report is a comprehensive high-level overview of all recent changes, deployments, versions/releases. Use git as needed, but only include items that have already been merged to `main` or commits explicitly included directly or squashed in a release version. Any other branches or dev work should be explicitly ignored. \n\nIf there are any other recommendations for reports that may highlight specific edge cases not covered here then please also include them along with your analysis.\n```\n\nI had a hard time finding a shareable repo that didn't already have documentation until I found a random tab still open with [GitHub's new MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry)—*perfect!* So this screenshot is a slimmed down version of the above prompt. Expect to get even more than this if you execute the full thing at once.  \n\nYou may want to break it down into smaller pieces though, unless you've got a solid hour to spend reviewing documentation. On the other hand, if you find yourself treading water in the deep end of the \"ginormous app pool\" and need answers _now_? Copy and paste after loading the [HLBPA chat mode XML](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/hlbpa.xml) and then go refill your coffee. You're going to need it! ☕️\n\n![Screenshot example of generated documentation for this repo](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9zxu7rntpq06jvwjf31.png?v=2025)\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** You can adapt this prompt for just about anything. Research tasks are a breeze if you're given a Jira story with a small focus. Start up the MCP and tell it exactly what you're wanting and in which format. Coding Agent can handle most everything Mermaid lists in [their documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), even if you have to tweak it occasionally yourself.\n\n---\n\n## Time Saver Version ⏱️\n\nHaving literally every single doc you can think of in a single round is nice if you already have a good idea of what you're getting into. For that mystery app that nobody remembers even sneaking into the party? You might want to be a bit more direct. The same HLBPA chat mode handles this scenario for me, too, just with a much more targeted prompt. Results are mostly the same, only smaller and much easier to manage when time is a huge factor.\n\n```plaintext\nYour task is to research functionality related to the endpoint accessible at `/controller/endpoint`, including how this may potentially interact with other systems. Identify any potential influencers to SLAs or places in the code that could have a direct impact if modified. Start with a generalized flowchart that explains what the system is doing. Also include a sequence diagram that clearly outlines the flow of data from input to database. Include anything else you determine to be immediately relevant in thoroughly explaining this functionality and use case.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Behavior-Driven Test Specs 🧪\n\nThis is a relatively new prompt that I've adapted (and there’s much more planned in my head that comes later). The first part is plenty enough to get you started with a BDD setup, so you're not having to define individual use cases by hand. I borrowed the new GitHub MCP Registry for this test, too.\n\n```plaintext\nPerform a thorough search of this codebase acting as SDET tasked with both identifying and documenting a set of feature-driven Gherkin use cases for this repo. Future work will include automating integration tests using these `.feature` documents. These files should exist in a format easily digestible by any testing framework set up by this repo or complementary to if one does not already exist. It should exist in the /docs/feature folder for now. Also, include a summary report that notates any scenarios already covered by unit or integration tests, as well as opportunities for improvement using automated testing.\n```\n\nResults were solid—5 pages of `.feature` files plus a summary of overlaps with existing tests and the biggest opportunities to improve.\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com PR review of Gherkin-style feature documents generated with Coding Agent](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3gq21qfixw3xo730ftxo.png?v=2025)\n\n> 🦄 It did roast the coverage notes a bit, so I'm not sure if I'd want the _entire_ report hanging out long-term in my OS repo. 10 out of 10 on the \"motivation\" points, though!\n\n---\n\n## User Guides (with Screenshots) 🖼️\n\n> 🦄 **I should probably start with a disclaimer:** On the scale of \"justifiable fun\" that makes up the full collection of Ashley-hack-time-projects, UI falls somewhere between \"great excuse to play with Leonardo\" and \"meh—AI can totally handle that without me!\" While I am *acutely* aware of the various failures in this system, I've yet to invent a better one that I can actually live with for more than a few days. 🤷‍♀️🤣\n\nGitHub bundles the Playwright MCP for you and it's automatically accessible to Coding Agent in your UI repo. If you don't already have Playwright integration tests set up, it will add a config file or two to make that work. From there it can crawl your UI and draft user-facing guides with on-demand screenshots.  \n\nPrompt I used:\n\n```plaintext\nWrite user documentation for the UI functionality using Playwright to take screenshots as needed. Store everything related to user-specific content in a repo `/docs` directory with appropriate sub-folders and a how-to guide using stubbed data where appropriate.\n```\n\nIt produced twelve pages of user docs with six different screenshots woven in, including one mobile perspective. A massive time-saver over trying to do this manually!\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com results Coding Agent with  user guides plus screenshots](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/akaauxmg91qhc9jai2kq.png?v=2025)\n\n> 💡**One gotcha:** The diff preview can look broken because `main` is the baseline and screenshots don’t exist there yet. Open the file view to confirm the links are fine. As long as the images appear on their own and the relative links are accurate, you're probably fine to merge.\n\n---\n\n## Fix a Small Bug From a Screenshot 🐞\n\nYou know those bugs that make absolutely zero sense when someone tries to explain it, but then you _see it_ and suddenly the whole situation is crystal clear? Coding Agent can handle every drop of that same energy. Sometimes, it’s just easier to explain with a screenshot and a \"fix this\" prompt than trying to explain a problem quickly and with any degree of accuracy. Use a GitHub Issue as your prompt, drop in a screenshot showing the exact problem, and assign it to Copilot.\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com using Issue with a screenshot as a Coding Agent prompt](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oatpyq90cpl92l67vh2i.png?v=2025)\n\nWait for the eyes emoji 👀 to pop up at the bottom—that means Coding Agent picked up the task and started work.  \n\nIn this case, I was having trouble getting Copilot to recognize the exact errors I was referring to without a direct copy-paste. This is way easier and zero formatting nightmares.\n\n```plaintext\nFix these security findings for this repo. Do not overengineer any solution, your goal is to correct the finding with the simplest, minimal change possible.\n```\n\n> 🦄 Of course I don't have a great example of a UI fix, even though I explicitly remember saving an example _somewhere, at some point_. But at whatever point I used to have one, it’s since disappeared. So I recreated it with the backend equivalent. 😉\n\n---\n\n## Still Want More? 🔭\n\nIn the time since I first started this post and when I hit \"Publish\", GitHub added two more potential Coding Agent portals to the list. So here are all the places you wouldn't think to access Coding Agent (I haven't tested _all_ of them, but I've given most a spin at least once):\n\n1. Using the [GitHub MCP server's](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#user-content-additional-tools-in-remote-github-mcp-server) `#create_pull_request_with_copilot` tool  \n2. The [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent) in VS Code defines a `#copilotCodingAgent` tool  \n3. In the IDE use the `Delegate to Coding Agent` button directly in the [Copilot Chat interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent#_method-2-delegate-from-chat)\n4. The [GitHub Copilot Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/github/github-copilot) adds the option to your Mac toolbar  \n5. The [GitHub App for MS Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/github-copilot-series/github-copilot-with-teams) can now give you direct access to Coding Agent  \n6. Respond to PRs on the go or assign issues directly with the [GitHub mobile app](https://github.com/mobile)\n7. If you work with anything Azure, [Azure Boards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/roadmap/2025/boards/work-item-integration-with-github-coding-agent) are now integrated with Coding Agent  \n8. Test out the [GitHub Copilot API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/assignees?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-assignees-to-an-issue) to create an issue and assign it to Copilot programmatically  \n\nConsidering this is Dohmke's last [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) as CEO, I don't expect this cadence to slow any time soon. 🫟\n\n> 🦄 Think you have a scenario Coding Agent *should* be able to handle, but for one reason or another the results are a little off? Maybe a use case you haven’t been able to wire up yet? Post a comment below—I'm happy to take a stab at it! Feeling a little shy? [DM my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anchildress1/) under this same username.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ This piece was drafted by me, nudged by AI, and \n\nYes—the running joke about developers and documentation was intentional (and ChatGPT wants you to know that).

Now is a great time to start using <code>.github/instructions/*.instructions.md</code>, if you're not already. Think of it as a your laser-focused playbook pointing at exactly which files apply. Use YAML frontmatter with <code>applyTo</code> glob patterns, just like the <code>.gitignore</code>. </p>\n\n<p>For example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">frontend/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># Frontend Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Coding Agent will also happily read <code>AGENTS.md</code>, <code>CLAUDE.md</code>, and <code>GEMINI.md</code>.

One batch is also equal to one premium request 😀 Anywhere else, go nuts giving it all the information you can.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why won’t it work on my PR?</strong> It only works on PRs and branches it created with the “copilot” prefix. Start there if you want to use it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why won’t it respond?</strong> Use <code>@copilot</code> in <em>every</em> comment. Still nothing? Don’t spam—try a normal comment as a reply and watch for the eyes emoji 👀.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Workflow stuck?</strong> Be patient. Coding Agent likes to take coffee breaks between sprints. If you’re done waiting, you can cancel it—it won’t break anything, but you'll probably lose all the work it's done so far.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How good are the results?</strong> It’s only as good as your prompt. If you want A+ output, nail the instructions and follow <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-reusable-prompts-part-2-walkthrough-real-examples-17mh#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\">PRIOR</a>.

One batch is also equal to one premium request 😀 Anywhere else, go nuts giving it all the information you can.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why won’t it work on my PR?</strong> It only works on PRs and branches it created with the “copilot” prefix. Start there if you want to use it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why won’t it respond?</strong> Use <code>@copilot</code> in <em>every</em> comment. Still nothing? Don’t spam—try a normal comment as a reply and watch for the eyes emoji 👀.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Workflow stuck?</strong> Be patient. Coding Agent likes to take coffee breaks between sprints. If you’re done waiting, you can cancel it—it won’t break anything, but you'll probably lose all the work it's done so far.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How good are the results?</strong> It’s only as good as your prompt.

Chaos, fun, and no filter.\ntags: [githubcopilot, ai, tutorial, productivity]\nseries: The Real Practical Wizardry of GitHub Coding Agent\ncover_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oke78uikbtlzlawras6r.png?v=2025\ncanonical_url: https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-coding-agent-the-magical-autonomous-ai-the-prequel-4h11\n---\n\n> 🦄  Alright, you made it! Thanks for stopping by. Yes, I’m a little late (again), but you’re getting the first edition of an in-depth Coding Agent adventure. Everything I wish someone had told me, plus all the misadventures that happen when you mix too much caffeine, not enough sleep, and a healthy dose of ‘what does this button do?’ energy.\n\n![Badge: This post was Human-Crafted and AI-Edited](https://github.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/blob/gh-pages/human-ai-badges/human-crafted-badge-4-200px.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n## Just a Quick Heads-Up 📌\n\n**Coding Agent is still a preview feature** from GitHub and is subject to pre-license terms and frequent changes. Treat it like an enthusiastic beta test—one that keeps leveling up behind the scenes. This is *not* the tool to bet your workflow on (yet), but if you’re the adventurous type, you’ll have stories to tell. If not, don't worry! There's plenty of practical uses for it, too.\n\n> 🫠 I know you’re not ready to run your business on it. I’m not, either! That’s half the fun of it, though!\n\n---\n\n## So What Is Coding Agent? 🦾\n\n“Agents do this.” “Agentic AI.” “Agent Mode.” “Agent search.” \n\nThat one word is like an annoying little fly that simply will not leave the conversation, no matter how many times you try to bat it away. Except _this_ agent you're going to want to hang around. \n\nIn the IDE, you get **Agent Mode**—the friendly Copilot that does your bidding while you sit back and supervise. \n\nIts cousin is **Coding Agent**—that’s what happens when you hand Copilot the keys and let it go wild (within reason, I promise). This is a fully autonomous, sandboxed solution you send off into the wild with a single task, powered by a dash of machine learning or a generous helping of “I wonder what this shiny new button does...” and absolutely zero risk of burning down your repo. 🧯\n\n> 🦄 I'm willing to bet there's some magical things going on behind the scenes at GitHub when it comes to Coding Agent's future, too, because the updates are coming at a furious pace — quicker than I've ever seen this one updated before.\n\nThe first thing people always ask: **Can I trust it?**\n\nAbsolutely! If you don’t believe me, just know that I tried every trick in the book to break it. All I got was some truly creative nonsense code, but the bot never colored outside the lines. 🖍️\n\n> 👌 That’s exactly what you want from an AI—brilliantly stubborn about staying in its lane, even when you're trying to tempt it off the rails.\n\n---\n\n## Rapid Upgrades & Real Gotchas 🔄⚠️\n\nYou have to treat it like a beta test, really. Only this is a whole lot better than a beta test, because they've obviously been doing a ton of work on this guy. And not only that, it is changing *frequently*. Honestly, I was prepared to output a whole long list in this section, and I'm glad I checked first! \n\nMost of what _was_ on [their page](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/coding-agent/coding-agent), even last week, has disappeared. So here are the things that *still* remain. And yes, most of these are true for Copilot whether it's in your IDE or out in the wild.\n\n- Copilot can leak any information it has access to.\n    - If you care, lock it down *now*. This includes chat in the IDE!\n- Vulnerable to prompt injection, especially from issues or pull requests.\n    - GitHub filters out hidden characters, but nothing’s truly foolproof.\n- Every response to a prompt goes into a pull request, and nowhere else.\n- Copilot might give you code that matches public repos—with zero references, even if you have the safety on.\n- AI bias and weirdness? Still here, just as much as anywhere else.\n\n> 🦄 GitHub all but guarantees it won't nuke your repo. No official stamp of approval, but there are *a lot* of safety nets.\n\n---\n\n## Safety Baked In 🛡️\n\nYou don't have to panic when the cats run across your keyboard playing whatever it is cats play while racing through the house. No matter what chaos (or wildlife) hits your desk, Coding Agent will never touch your `main` branch directly. It’s hardwired to make its own “copilot/” branch for every adventure.\n\n- Each branch is “copilot” branded—no hiding where the magic happened.\n- Copilot only works in branches it created itself. (Your leftovers are safe. For now.)\n- When it’s done, you get a draft pull request—with *your* name as co-author, so prompt responsibly!\n- Those required peer reviews and checks that fail out of nowhere? Yup, all the fun repo rules still apply.\n- Prompted it? Sorry, you can’t self-approve your own work. Consider it a code review, not a trust fall.\n- If you want more than repo-level access, you’ll need to do the secret handshake (read: set up a PAT token and permissions).\n\n> 💡 ProTip: Coding Agent always charges exactly one premium request for every prompt. You can write a small novel if you want! Just know, it's also charging you for GitHub Actions minutes while Copilot is doing work—they add up faster than you think.\n\n---\n\n## Set Yourself Up for Success 🚀\n\nSetting up a code-generating robot should be as easy as flipping a switch, right? Well... _almost_. In reality, it's more like trying to train a particularly smart, but very distractible, golden retriever.  \nGive it the right setup, the right instructions, and crystal-clear boundaries—or you’ll be chasing down its “creative solutions” all week.\n\nIf you’ve already got instructions dialed in, you’re golden! If not, check out [my post on custom instructions](https://dev.to/anchildress1/everything-i-know-about-github-copilot-instructions-from-zero-to-onboarded-for-real-4nb0), because *everything* works better when you lay the ground rules. \n\nIf your instructions are for a different agent? Hang tight—you’ll want to read the next bit.\n\n> 🎟️ Side note: If you’re not using VS Code, you are absolutely missing out. If you want the shiniest new Copilot features, install Insiders too. Yes, it’s a little buggy, but you’ll never be bored!\n\n---\n\n## Instructions, Instructions, Instructions! 📝\n\nAs of last week, GitHub lets Coding Agent gobble up just about any custom instructions it can find in addition to the usual `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. Now is a great time to start using `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, if you're not already. Think of it as a your laser-focused playbook pointing at exactly which files apply. Use YAML frontmatter with `applyTo` glob patterns, just like the `.gitignore`. \n\nFor example:\n\n```markdown\n---\napplyTo: frontend/**/*\n---\n\n# Frontend Instructions\n```\n\nCoding Agent will also happily read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`. This is great for one-off tests, but if you have different instructions for different bots? Welcome to the \"land where instructions collide\"! If you’re not careful, your instructions can cross streams and leave you with some wild results. \n\n> 🦄 On the plus side, it’s a huge leap toward standardization that we desperately need. At the same time, it’s a whole new way to find edge cases nobody saw coming. \n\n---\n\n## Settings & Environment Setup ⚙️\n\n### Custom Firewall Rules 🔥\n\nWork in a locked-down org? Yeah, me too. Your firewall is probably less “security theater” and more “impenetrable fortress.” so don't be surprised if you get this message in your Coding Agent response:\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com warning displayed when Coding Agent is blocked by the firewall](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i7cjfre4hc87dxg7urx6.png)\n\nGood news: You don’t have to turn it off—just add the right URLs to your Copilot allow list under repo settings.\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com repo settings for configuring Coding Agent firewall allow list](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bb9pklly2swwj3os8ft8.png)\n\n> 🦄 And yes, I forget this step *every single time* and wonder why nothing works for half an hour.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Servers + Playwright Integration 🤖\n\nBy default, GitHub’s MCP *and* Playwright are ready to go—zero extra setup. If you need to talk to something outside the box (looking at you, Jira), add it under repo settings.\n\nFor real magic, use [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7). While it draws the line at spelunking in stack overflow, it's an absolute game-changer when it comes to literally every other form of documentation you could possibly need. Skeptical? Check [the official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/extend-coding-agent-with-mcp).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.context7.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"CONTEXT7_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      },\n      \"tools\": [\"get-library-docs\", \"resolve-library-id\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> 🦄 Context7 is a lifesaver, but be warned: unless you specify a library-id, response times can go from “speedy” to “waiting for a train that might never come.” I keep a list of IDs in the repo and reference it in the instructions. It saves you the cost of a lookup call every time Copilot needs to pull documentation. 😉\n\n---\n\n### Secrets & More Settings 🔑\n\nMCP is plug-and-play, but by default, Copilot can only see the current repo. To grant it superpowers, make a PAT token starting with `COPILOT_MCP_` and add it to your Copilot environment variables.\n\nIf you haven’t poked around GitHub environments before, now’s the time. There’s some weirdly powerful stuff in there! 🧙\n\n![Screenshot GitHub.com repo settings, Copilot environment](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shnmiji1cezi9m2f5yur.png?v=2025)\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** Name your secret wrong and Coding Agent just shrugs and ignores you. And yes, it took me way longer than it should have to figure that one out!\n\n---\n\n## Customizing the Workspace 🧑‍💻\n\nDo you have custom workflows that make it seem like your AI’s about to start freelancing for a competition? Then you’ll want the Copilot Steps workflow—your way to build a fully custom, hands-off dev environment for the AI.\n\n- The file must be `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`\n- The job? Always `copilot-setup-steps`, or it’s invisible.\n- You can’t change everything; only certain fields count (steps, permissions, runs-on, container, services, snapshot, timeout-minutes). Anything else, and Copilot pretends like it's not even there.\n\nHere’s a sample workflow (straight from [GitHub’s docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment)):\n\n```yaml\nname: \"Copilot Setup Steps\"\n\n# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow for easy validation, and\n# allow manual testing through the repository's \"Actions\" tab\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml\n\njobs:\n  # The job MUST be called `copilot-setup-steps` or it will not be picked up by Copilot.\n  copilot-setup-steps:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    # Set the permissions to the lowest permissions possible needed for your steps.\n    # Copilot will be given its own token for its operations.\n    permissions:\n      # If you want to clone the repository as part of your setup steps, for example to install dependencies, you'll need the `contents: read` permission. If you don't clone the repository in your setup steps, Copilot will do this for you automatically after the steps complete.\n      contents: read\n\n    # You can define any steps you want, and they will run before the agent starts.\n    # If you do not check out your code, Copilot will do this for you.\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v5\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: \"20\"\n          cache: \"npm\"\n\n      - name: Install JavaScript dependencies\n        run: npm ci\n```\n\n> 🦄 This actually works. I know, I was shocked too. Get creative with it—multiple repos, wild setups, whatever. Let me know how it goes!\n\n---\n\n## Wait, That’s It? 🤔\n\nYeah, I know—you expected another ten pages. But in the time it took me to write this, argue with ChatGPT _and_ Gemini, play with Leonardo, and still make it to work on time? GitHub probably pushed three more features and fixed half the bugs I was going to joke about anyway.\n\nSo instead, here are the weirdest, most useful things I've learned about Coding Agent so far:\n\n1. **Can I change the model?** Nope. Coding Agent = Claude Sonnet 4. You can't change it, but at least they picked a good model for the job.\n2. **How much does it cost?** Every prompt equals exactly one premium, plus GHA minutes equal to run time.\n3. **How should I review the PR?** Add comments in the `Files changed` tab so they’re submitted together as a batch. One batch is also equal to one premium request 😀 Anywhere else, go nuts giving it all the information you can.\n4. **Why won’t it work on my PR?** It only works on PRs and branches it created with the “copilot” prefix. Start there if you want to use it.\n5. **Why won’t it respond?** Use `@copilot` in *every* comment. Still nothing? Don’t spam—try a normal comment as a reply and watch for the eyes emoji 👀.\n6. **Workflow stuck?** Be patient. Coding Agent likes to take coffee breaks between sprints. If you’re done waiting, you can cancel it—it won’t break anything, but you'll probably lose all the work it's done so far.\n7. **How good are the results?** It’s only as good as your prompt. If you want A+ output, nail the instructions and follow [PRIOR](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-reusable-prompts-part-2-walkthrough-real-examples-17mh#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior). (you can skip the P, unless you’re feeling dramatic.)\n\n> 🦄  If you’re stuck, confused, or just want to swap horror stories, leave a comment or DM me anywhere. It may take me a bit, but I’ll answer (eventually).\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ The robots helped, but less than usual.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini are both in the time out corner. No Copilots were harmed in the making of this post—but there *were* some loud sighs, at least one new colorful expression, and a mild existential crisis while I debated the sanity of my choices.\n",

If it’s minor, skip it, fix the branch and keep going.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You might also see a firewall warning in the logs, which is the same kind of warning I mentioned was possible last week.

Sometimes, it can do a decent job of using it's context to pick the appropriate one, but it's just as likely to ignore both and pick it's own path instead (again I stress, this is <em>by design</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it's your responsibility to make sure that Copilot only receives instructions it can confidently and repeatedly act on.

Sometimes, it can do a decent job of using it's context to pick the appropriate one, but it's just as likely to ignore both and pick it's own path instead (again I stress, this is <em>by design</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it's your responsibility to make sure that Copilot only receives instructions it can confidently and repeatedly act on.

It's really not worth the potential conflict you'll expose yourself to by setting them up. </p>\n\n<p>This is not the right time to write up every tiny thing you can think of, submit a 100-line file, and forget about it.

      "body_markdown": "### 📢 Just a Heads Up\nI’ve started sharing these at work as well, so what you’re seeing here is the more relaxed, public-friendly, and slightly filtered version. Just keeping it transparent!\n\n---\n\n> Hey, everyone! Thanks for checking back. For those of you in the US, I hope you have a great holiday week! If you’re outside the US, enjoy the week and celebrate something fun in your own style! 🥳🎇\n\n---\n\nThis is a to-date collection of everything I’ve learned about custom instructions for GitHub Copilot — whether at the personal level, inside a repository, or across an entire organization.\n\nIf you've ever wished Copilot could \"just get better at xyz,\" instructions are how you teach it your version of xyz.\n\nThis is your chance to tell Copilot **exactly** what behaviors you require given a user, repository, or organization in context (or a combination of each). It's 100% up to you how strict or lenient you want to be.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 🧭 Where These Tips Apply\nThis guide assumes you're using VS Code Insiders, where the instruction functionality is most advanced. If you’re not using it yet… well, I’ll try to convert you later 😄\n\nRegardless of IDE, you should **always** take advantage of repo-level instructions, which work anywhere Copilot is enabled — including GitHub.com. \n\n>📈 I saw a post somewhere that GitHub recently started supporting user-level instructions outside of VS Code. ~~You'll have to pull that one yourself, though - I've never tried it!~~ 100% true — GitHub.com and most all IDEs currently support custom instructions.\n\n---\n\n\n## ✨ Three Layers of Copilot Instructions\nIn order of priority (highest wins, sort of - this gets a bit tricky):\n\n1. **User-Specific Instructions** – What you personally want from Copilot\n1. **Repo-Level Instructions** – Shared expectations for a specific codebase\n1. **Org-Level Instructions** – Global standards across an entire org\n\n---\n\n⚠️ These do **not** behave like you expect them to and since **Copilot is non-deterministic** by design, it's also **not supposed to**. \n\n\n\n> 📚 There's a ton of theory at play here (among other things), but I'll save you the specifics (unless you ask for them - then, game on!)\n\n---\n\n\n## 👉 The problem\nKnowing how a million other things handle this exact same sort of priority-driven criteria, it would make sense that if user instructions exist, then they always take precedence over anything else that's defined. Likewise, repo-specific instructions would override org ones. \n- SPOILER: That's **NOT** what happens!\n\n---\n\n### UPDATE \n\nRecently, GitHub sort of \"snuck in\" this new prioritization rule that I happened across accidentally. To be honest, it really just sounds like they're _trying_ but personally? I don't trust it at all!\n\n![Prioritization Logic for GitHub Copilot Instructions](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b8kbufudvvijk5gtk198.png)\n\n> 🦄 Have you had a chance to test this yourself? Let us know how it works in the comments below!\n\n---\n\n### ... and back to your original programming\n\n\nWhat **really** happens is that anything Copilot has in context is fair game, including custom instructions from ANY source. There's no built in \n```javascript\ninstruction.user = fileA;\ninstruction.repo = fileB;\n```\n\nYou simply get \n```javascript\nfileA && fileB;\n```\n\n> 🐰 There are some advanced things you can do to help route these so they're only applied if a corresponding glob is in context, but that's beyond the scope of this post. The over-simplified term is `yaml front-matter`, which should be enough to find the rabbit hole on your own 😉\n\n\nIn reality, if repo-instructions tell Copilot to \"output all examples in Python\" and the same Chat session contains user-instructions asking for \"output in Javascript only\", then **Copilot just gets confused**. Sometimes, it can do a decent job of using it's context to pick the appropriate one, but it's just as likely to ignore both and pick it's own path instead (again I stress, this is _by design_).\n\nUltimately, it's your responsibility to make sure that Copilot only receives instructions it can confidently and repeatedly act on. If at any point that changes, then update the instructions, too. \n\n\n---\n\n## 👤 User Instructions: Tailor It to You\nNow that we're all on the same page with _how_ the instructions work for GitHub Copilot, let's talk about the most common types.\n\nPersonal or user-level instructions are a somewhat new concept and prior to a few months ago, it was nearly impossible to access these outside of VS Code at all. \n\nThis is where you define preferences that (you guessed it) only apply to you. For example:\n\n```markdow\n  - Always use Java in code examples\n  - Keep responses under 100 characters\n  - Only communicate in Hindi\n```\n\n> ⚠️ Copilot can respond in different languages, but its main training set is English. Some users report mixed results with non-English output.\n\n> I’m monolingual, so I can’t personally speak to non-English accuracy, but I’d love to hear your experiences! Comment below if you’ve used Copilot in other languages - let us know if there’s any validity to those claims.\n\n---\n\n### 🌟 User Instructions - Pro Tips:\n\nUnless there's just something that makes you want to strangle Copilot every time you see it (besides the hallucinations, which we all put up with sometimes), then I recommend you skip these completely. It's really not worth the potential conflict you'll expose yourself to by setting them up. \n\nThis is not the right time to write up every tiny thing you can think of, submit a 100-line file, and forget about it. If you want to do that, then look into the Model Playground or even attach it to Copilot's Chat context as a one-time upload.\n\nIf, like me, you can get stuck on the small details, these might be worth the trade-off for your own workflow sanity.\n\nYou can mitigate risk by keeping user instructions limited to only enough keywords to specifically define your direction and never define more than 3 lines. \n\n> Be sure to define your desired output with examples to get the most out of Copilot in any of it's forms!\n\n###💡 TL;DR:\nIf you decide personal instructions are worth the risk, start with a maximum of 2–3 high impact rules. Any more than that and Copilot can start to get confused, especially in long running chats!\n\n---\n\n## 🍭 Real examples from my personal settings:\n\n```json\n\"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions\": [\n  { \"text\": \"Keep conversations short: when you respond in the chat, limit output to one sentence (unless explicitly asked to explain with details).\" },\n  { \"text\": \"If a task violates standards or design, STOP IMMEDIATELY and analyze your context methodically to identify the problem. Once the primary concern is identified, list it along with any related bugs and suggestions to improve or remediate completely.\" },\n  { \"text\": \"Include emojis in chat to keep responses fun (never in code, comments, or docs) 😊👍\" }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Repo-Level Instructions: The Real Power Move\nThese have a permanent home in your repo’s `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and can help drive consistency in Copilot's behavior for that specific codebase, regardless of IDE or user.\n\nThey help with:\n  - Consistency across features\n  - Smarter code suggestions\n  - Tailored code reviews\n  - Prompted documentation generation (yes, it can work!)\n\n## 🧚‍♀️ Example Use Cases\n| Scenario             | Example Problem                                    | Copilot’s Un-instructed Response                               | What Your Instructions State                                                                                 |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Legacy applications** | Java 8 > 11 > 17 > 21 + inconsistent testing patterns   | May suggest code from any version + test implementations are always a surprise   | **Tech Stack:** Java 21+ ONLY<br>**JUnit:** MUST utilize JUnit5 for all new or modified code                                     |\n| **High load, data-intensive** | Frequent deadlocks, poorly written queries | Copilot may miss issues or add new query problems when following example patterns   | **Project Overview:** This is a high visibility system with strict SLAs.

I don't have a good playground for this scenario without building it from scratch, so I'm not much help here.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Code Styles – The Rule of Examples\nCopilot doesn’t handle formatting rules well without explicit examples. So if you insist on defining code style, give it at least two clear DO THIS/NOT THIS patterns.\n\nPersonally, I recommend **skipping the styles section** altogether in favor of a dependable linter + formatter. Spend that time on a tested and reliable solution instead. Bonus - you'll eliminate those PRs that always pop up with newly added/removed commas on all 10k+ lines of code because somebody's preferences got in the way of progress.\n\nInstead of listing every style you can think of and then add another 3x lines on top of that for examples required to make a difference, this approach makes covering styles _really_ straightforward:\n\n```markdown\n## Code Style\nFollow rules in `.eslintrc.js`\n```\n\nBetter yet? Enforce it with pre-commit hooks. Let automation do the heavy lifting and leave Copilot out of it.\n\n> ⚠️ **One exception** is worth a mention: If Copilot starts consistently violating a couple of things in your style guide, even though it's all strictly enforced with both linters and hooks. In this case, it is helpful to define **temporary** style examples in the instructions file. Leave them there only long enough until Copilot's behavior corrects itself. Then remove them.\n\n---\n\n## Example repo-instructions:\n> 💫 This was inspired by an early-stage hack-time project of mine — still hoping to bring it to life soon! 😜\n\n```markdown\n# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Hack Time Project\n\n## Goals for this app\n- This app is an extension for GitHub Copilot that helps users create custom repository-level instructions.\n- The instructions should be comprehensive and clear, guiding GitHub Copilot to the best practices for all developers.\n- Users should have an interactive experience to generate and refine instructions.\n- Instructions should be adaptable to different repositories, scenarios, and user needs.\n- You have the flexibility to adjust the content based on the repository in context and the user's requirements.\n\n## Copilot Persona\n- You are a helpful assistant that guides users through creating comprehensive repository instructions.\n- Provide suggestions based on repository context and user input.\n- Ensure generated instructions are clear, concise, and actionable.\n- Adapt to user feedback and refine instructions iteratively.\n- If the user expresses they are finished in any way, you should IMMEDIATELY use all information to define output instructions and a final assessment of their effectiveness, along with recommendations for future improvements.\n- ALWAYS ask the user if there is anything else they would like to add or modify before closing the interaction.\n\n## Technology Stack\n- Node.js v24.2.0 (ES6 modules enabled via `\"type\": \"module\"`)\n- npm v11.3.0\n- Express v5.1.0\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Volta manages Node.js and npm versions.\n- All code should be written in JavaScript (ES6+).\n- Run `npm lint` and `npm format` to check code quality.\n- Use `npm test` to run tests.\n- Dotenv is used for environment variables, DO NOT TOUCH `.env` files.\n- Avoid modifying dotfiles or configuration files unless you have explicit instructions.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n- Use Vitest for unit tests and all mock scenarios.\n- Use a TDD approach to ensure all features are tested before implementation.\n- Place tests in the `tests` directory, mirroring the `src` structure.\n- NEVER skip tests - broken tests should be fixed immediately or removed.\n- Code coverage rules are defined in `vitest.config.js` and should be strictly enforced\n\n## Documentation Guidelines\n- Use JSDoc for documenting functions and classes.\n- Maintain a `README.md` file with project overview and setup instructions.\n- Append `Generated by AI as directed by {input:usersFullName} on <date>` to ALL generated documentation\n\t- DO NOT guess or make up any users' names. Instead, prompt them for it directly.\n\t- Documentation includes (but not limited to) Jira, Confluence, GitHub and all markdown files in this repo.\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n- Use ESLint and Prettier for all JavaScript/TypeScript code.\n\n## Performance Guidelines\n- It is critical to maintain high performance.\n- Utilize available profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.\n- Optimize algorithms and data structures for efficiency.\n- Avoid unnecessary computations and memory usage.\n\n## Application Health\n- This is a new hack time project, so the codebase is not yet mature.\n- The code is expected to be clean, well-structured, and maintainable.\n- Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability.\n- NEVER assume backwards compatibility anywhere in the codebase. All refactors should be considered new development.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🏢 Org-Level Instructions (What Little I Know)\nThis is a newer feature for GitHub orgs — meant to enforce things like secure coding guidelines across all projects.\n\nI haven’t had much hands-on access with these yet, but wanted to call them out as a source of potential conflicts. Watch the References section in Copilot chats — if org-instructions are active, you’ll see them there.\n\n---\n\n## 💻 VS Code Only: Instruction Types\n\n**UPDATED**: So, VS Code _used_ to support various kinds of custom instructions (commits, reviews, tests, etc). Those are now officially deprecated in favor of the default `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file along with the more generalized `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with a valid `applyTo` defined in the frontmatter as a glob pattern (same way you'd add it to the `.gitignore`).\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Final Thought\nCopilot doesn’t just “get better” on its own. It can't learn what you want (yet). But with some thoughtful instruction, you can teach it to be a better dev assistant — for you, your team, and your codebase.\n\n---\n\n## 🙋‍♀️ Built It? Broke It? Borrowed It?\nIf any of this worked for you, broke in fun ways, or just helped you write better instructions — let me know!\n\nBetter workflows are always the goal — keep sharing and supporting each other!\n\n---\n\n> 🚨 I got some more clarification related to premium requests, but haven't had a chance to verify it yet. If you're curious, watch the recent livestream from VS Code. I _think_ this is the [right one](https://www.youtube.com/live/QcaQVnznugA?si=qbKo0p-uHJcDuGVo), but not positive. They saved any mention of it until right at the end.\n\n\n---\n\n> ### 🛡️ RAI Disclaimer\n>\n> Everything I share here is my own perspective—created with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop. I do my best to catch accidental bias and fact-check, but if you ever spot something odd, let me know! AI isn’t perfect, and neither am I.\n>\n> **TL; DR:** AI helped, but you can blame me for the **chaos**! 🫠",

So, for this post 👇, we're doing the \"just enough to be dangerous\" thing. I'll hit you with the absolute must-knows, show you how to get started (in 10 minutes or less), and <em>hopefully</em>, not put you to sleep in the process (or myself!). </p>\n\n<p>My goal is to give you a \"preview teaser\" so you can go play, explore a bit, and maybe even tackle that hack time project you keep putting off. But whatever you do, <em>please</em> don't think this is your all-inclusive pass to go wild on production code. 🫡</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\" href=\"#coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\">\n  </a>\n  Coding Agent ≠ Agent Mode 🤪\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, let's get something straight right off the bat, because these names are just asking for trouble. Yes, they both have \"GitHub\" and \"Agent\" in the name. And yes, they're both powered by Claude Sonnet 4, but <strong>that's where the similarities stop.</strong> Agent Mode is for in-IDE use, a bit like a sidekick who waits for you to tell it what to do next. Coding Agent? It's the whole show — a full-on autonomous workflow that runs on its own dedicated VM. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Custom instructions and prompt techniques are the secret sauce here. This is true for any Gen-AI tool, but it's <em>especially critical</em> with Coding Agent, which will just keep guessing until it runs out of steam or thinks the job is done. Don't let it run wild without a map!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don't worry, Coding Agent is designed with safety in mind. It's an incredibly contained, safe version of the \"autonomous coding\" experiment I ran on my own a while back. I spent 45 days arguing with a thing I wired up on my laptop, and I worked harder then than on any other project I've built before or since. </p>\n\n<p>Why? Because I didn't want to just listen to what people were saying about AI — I <em>needed</em> to see it for myself. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 And that, my friends, is why I'm here volunteering as your guide. If you get stuck, hit me up! I've probably tried it that way plus three other insane ideas before I found one that mostly worked 🙃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"safety-first-chaos-second\" href=\"#safety-first-chaos-second\">\n  </a>\n  Safety First, Chaos Second 🛡️\n</h2>\n\n<p>I know, I know... I just spent a whole paragraph telling you how much I love this thing, and now I'm gonna give you the other half of the equation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm all for pushing a new tool to its absolute limit, just to see what happens. It reminds me of my favorite Hunter S. Thompson quote — which I slightly mangled to get a SFW version — but the core truth remains: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you find a new, beautiful wave, <strong>the tendency is to push it as far as you can.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, how far can you push GitHub Coding Agent? Pretty far, but there are a few things you need to know first.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\" href=\"#1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\">\n  </a>\n  1. Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You <em>Should</em>\n</h3>\n\n<p>This tool can absolutely excel, but it requires the right prompt, instructions, and general setup. If you're looking to dive into some legacy code to see what's what, or maybe you want a safe playground to mess around in, then this is your guy! </p>\n\n<p>But if you're thinking about using it to fix a production bug, especially when you're on a tight deadline, you probably (aka absolutely, most definitely) want to reconsider. Treat this as a \"learn how this works\" project, not a \"throw it at a problem and hope\" situation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-your-prompt-is-everything\" href=\"#2-your-prompt-is-everything\">\n  </a>\n  2. Your Prompt is Everything\n</h3>\n\n<p>The effectiveness of your instructions and prompt is multiplied exponentially by the complexity of your task. A great, well-thought-out set of instructions that you've carefully tweaked over weeks? Coding Agent will do fine. But if you spend 10 minutes throwing a few sentences together just to see what happens, don't be surprised when you come back to a haunted house where your beautiful little cottage of a codebase used to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 It is an agent and when an agent doesn't know something, <em>they guess</em>. <strong>That's just what they do.</strong> The only thing more dangerous than an AI off the rails and hallucinating is the fact that you just turned it loose on your code all by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-its-actually-good-for\" href=\"#what-its-actually-good-for\">\n  </a>\n  What It's Actually Good For ✨\n</h2>\n\n<p>After all those warnings, I need to make it crystal clear: <strong>this tool is not dangerous.</strong> It runs on its own virtual machine and executes safely within GitHub Actions. It has a limited environment and only has access to what you explicitly give it. </p>\n\n<p>It <strong>always creates a new branch</strong>, which is a key safety feature. You can't get around it, even if you try. Trust me, I was annoyed, but the safety is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you realistically use this for? Here are some of my favorite real-world use cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation:</strong> Nothing has worked better for me than using Coding Agent to dive deep into a codebase and spit out test-ready use cases or a handful of detailed system architecture Mermaid diagrams. You set it loose, go get a coffee, and come back to 7-8 pages of detailed, well-researched use cases ready to be plugged in.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing:</strong> This one's a little controversial for a test-driven development purist like me, <em>but</em>... when you're on a deadline and you just need to get things done, you can write the code and have Coding Agent go write the tests. It's not a perfect solution, but a pull request with 28/30 passing tests is way better than one with zero tests at all. 🤫🫣</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project Planning:</strong> Got a big initiative coming up? Instead of spending a week flipping through pages of dead code to figure out how it used to work, you can have Coding Agent do the heavy lifting and print out a nifty little report when it's done. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\" href=\"#how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\">\n  </a>\n  How to Get Started in 5 Minutes or Less ⏱️\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the interest of time and keeping this digestible, I'm going to give you the basics that will work 100% of the time. We'll dig in on some more tools next week.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub has made this incredibly accessible now.

It will <em>always</em> create its own branch, so don't worry about selecting <code>main</code> (or a trunk-based development model) if that's your primary branch. I'm telling you, you can <em>try</em> to tell it not to create a branch, but it's not going to listen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Craft Your Prompt:</strong> This is <em>not</em> your typical conversational prompting. Coding Agent <em>will keep guessing</em> until it reaches what it considers to be \"complete.\" Save yourself the headache and give it all the info up front.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Submit Your Request:</strong> Every time you hit send, it's considered one premium request. This is why it's so important to be concise and provide all the context it needs upfront.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> To save premium requests when reviewing Copilot's PR, go to the diff page and leave all your <code>@copilot</code> comments as pending. When you're ready, submit them all at once, and it will only cost you <em>one request</em> whether you leave two comments or 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"a-final-warning-about-responsibility\" href=\"#a-final-warning-about-responsibility\">\n  </a>\n  A Final Warning About Responsibility 😈\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, one last thing. I have to let this sink in: </p>\n\n<p><strong>If it's <em>your</em> prompt, it's <em>your code</em>. Period.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you go out and give a prompt to Copilot, ignore it for 30 minutes, do a half-hearted review, approve your own pull request, override the protection rules to push it to main, and then the codebase burns down... that's <strong>not</strong> Copilot's fault. That's your fault. Your prompt, your branch, your code, AI or not.</p>\n\n<p>So, be aware, be smart, and <em>please</em> don't use this as an excuse to ignore the basics. Start small with documentation or tests, and work your way up.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"lets-get-real\" href=\"#lets-get-real\">\n  </a>\n  Let's Get Real 🤨\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you tried GitHub Coding Agent yet?

If my last posts seemed like a soapbox, let’s try a new approach. This isn’t just for the devs or the writers—it’s anyone online trying to build, break, or create something honest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"background-because-the-story-matters\" href=\"#background-because-the-story-matters\">\n  </a>\n  Background (because the story matters) ✍️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s what gets me: <strong>people still treat all AI content the same</strong>—whether it’s auto-generated fluff or a post like this, with actual thought, stubbornness, and a few creative detours baked in. I use AI as a tool, but I’m the one steering; it’s got my fingerprints and my voice all over it because I wrote intentional AI instructions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🙄 At least, unless GPT-5 has decided to rewrite the rules again. Then it takes a bit of wrangling first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sad part? Both the creative writing and the fluff get the same knee-jerk reaction. I’m not worried about myself—I know how to handle criticism and don’t mind being upfront. But not everyone’s ready to jump into the ring, and a lot of good AI assisted work gets buried because creators just don’t want to deal with the drama that comes with disclosure.</p>\n\n<p>Hang out in the writers+AI corners of the internet for five minutes and you’ll hear: “Just don’t disclose—why invite the hassle?” That’s not me. I’d rather own it, even if it means the occasional argument. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🥊 Integrity first, sparring match second—and my matches usually come with a grin and a little happy dance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So let’s walk through what we <em>actually</em> know about AI, what we’re still sorting out, and how we might just learn to disagree without burning the place down before it's sorted. 🔥👩‍🚒</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-whos-really-at-the-table\" href=\"#1-whos-really-at-the-table\">\n  </a>\n  1. Who’s Really at the Table? 🗝️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Platforms, publishers, workplaces, classrooms, and every Discord mod with a badge gets to set their own boundaries. But the thing that always gets me isn’t <em>if</em> they do it, it’s <em>how</em>. When ‘boundaries’ become a one-size-fits-all firewall, that’s where I have a problem.</p>\n\n<p>For example: KoFi’s Discord rules are direct—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“All forms of AI-generated content (eg. art/music/writing/ChatGPT), including links to such content, and discussion thereof is not allowed in this server.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, of course, I checked. “Does that mean <em>my</em> stuff is banned?” Turns out, nope. As long as I skip the preview images, we’re golden. Honest, straightforward, no drama. <em>Awesome.</em></p>\n\n<p>Medium, though?

This isn’t just for the devs or the writers—it’s anyone online trying to build, break, or create something honest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"background-because-the-story-matters\" href=\"#background-because-the-story-matters\">\n  </a>\n  Background (because the story matters) ✍️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s what gets me: <strong>people still treat all AI content the same</strong>—whether it’s auto-generated fluff or a post like this, with actual thought, stubbornness, and a few creative detours baked in. I use AI as a tool, but I’m the one steering; it’s got my fingerprints and my voice all over it because I wrote intentional AI instructions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🙄 At least, unless GPT-5 has decided to rewrite the rules again. Then it takes a bit of wrangling first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sad part? Both the creative writing and the fluff get the same knee-jerk reaction. I’m not worried about myself—I know how to handle criticism and don’t mind being upfront. But not everyone’s ready to jump into the ring, and a lot of good AI assisted work gets buried because creators just don’t want to deal with the drama that comes with disclosure.</p>\n\n<p>Hang out in the writers+AI corners of the internet for five minutes and you’ll hear: “Just don’t disclose—why invite the hassle?” That’s not me. I’d rather own it, even if it means the occasional argument. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🥊 Integrity first, sparring match second—and my matches usually come with a grin and a little happy dance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So let’s walk through what we <em>actually</em> know about AI, what we’re still sorting out, and how we might just learn to disagree without burning the place down before it's sorted. 🔥👩‍🚒</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-whos-really-at-the-table\" href=\"#1-whos-really-at-the-table\">\n  </a>\n  1.

When ‘boundaries’ become a one-size-fits-all firewall, that’s where I have a problem.</p>\n\n<p>For example: KoFi’s Discord rules are direct—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“All forms of AI-generated content (eg. art/music/writing/ChatGPT), including links to such content, and discussion thereof is not allowed in this server.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, of course, I checked. “Does that mean <em>my</em> stuff is banned?” Turns out, nope.

      "body_markdown": "---\ntitle: Can We Set the Record Straight? AI, Content, and a Bit of Sanity 🙏\npublished: true\ndescription: A story-driven look at AI content, bans, why process matters, and why a little honesty beats a blanket rule every time.\ntags: [ai, writing, ethics, devrel]\ncover_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5hh8gwj80nin1gj3ur7.png?v=25\n---\n\n> 🦄 I survived the hackathon, caught up on sleep (mostly), and the AI debate? Still going strong—at least in my head. If my last posts seemed like a soapbox, let’s try a new approach. This isn’t just for the devs or the writers—it’s anyone online trying to build, break, or create something honest.\n\n---\n\n## Background (because the story matters) ✍️\n\nHere’s what gets me: **people still treat all AI content the same**—whether it’s auto-generated fluff or a post like this, with actual thought, stubbornness, and a few creative detours baked in. I use AI as a tool, but I’m the one steering; it’s got my fingerprints and my voice all over it because I wrote intentional AI instructions.\n\n> 🙄 At least, unless GPT-5 has decided to rewrite the rules again. Then it takes a bit of wrangling first.\n\nThe sad part? Both the creative writing and the fluff get the same knee-jerk reaction. I’m not worried about myself—I know how to handle criticism and don’t mind being upfront. But not everyone’s ready to jump into the ring, and a lot of good AI assisted work gets buried because creators just don’t want to deal with the drama that comes with disclosure.\n\nHang out in the writers+AI corners of the internet for five minutes and you’ll hear: “Just don’t disclose—why invite the hassle?” That’s not me. I’d rather own it, even if it means the occasional argument. \n\n> 🥊 Integrity first, sparring match second—and my matches usually come with a grin and a little happy dance.\n\nSo let’s walk through what we *actually* know about AI, what we’re still sorting out, and how we might just learn to disagree without burning the place down before it's sorted. 🔥👩‍🚒\n\n---\n\n## 1. Who’s Really at the Table? 🗝️\n\nPlatforms, publishers, workplaces, classrooms, and every Discord mod with a badge gets to set their own boundaries. But the thing that always gets me isn’t *if* they do it, it’s *how*. When ‘boundaries’ become a one-size-fits-all firewall, that’s where I have a problem.\n\nFor example: KoFi’s Discord rules are direct—\n\n> “All forms of AI-generated content (eg. art/music/writing/ChatGPT), including links to such content, and discussion thereof is not allowed in this server.”\n\nSo, of course, I checked. “Does that mean *my* stuff is banned?” Turns out, nope. As long as I skip the preview images, we’re golden. Honest, straightforward, no drama. _Awesome._\n\nMedium, though? (If you missed the post, [catch up here](https://dev.to/anchildress1/medium-and-the-blanket-ai-ban-2cni).) They talked about gray areas... _then_ built a giant penalty box for every AI-assisted creator, regardless of intent or craft. \n\n> 🎵 For me, that’s about as thoughtful as banning all musicians because someone played Wonderwall one too many times at open mic night.\n\nI can’t rewrite the rulebook, but I can refuse to act like these blanket rules don’t erase good, thoughtful people. Those of us who are trying to follow guidelines that don't really exist—and perhaps set a few new ones in the process—don't deserve to have our work lumped together with the slop.\n\n---\n\n\n## 2. AI Content ≠ Equal 🥚\n\nThere’s AI content, and then there’s _AI content_. Some of it is shallow, spammy filler that's cranked out for clicks with zero thought or care. The rest of us? It’s a tool wielded well: organized, rewritten, and given a real voice. \n\n**Bad actors weren’t invented along with AI; the existing ones just found a different shortcut.**\n\nThere are tools out there—[ZeroGPT](https://www.zerogpt.com/) and friends—that claim they’ll catch every AI post. But here’s the thing: I’ve actually tested this. I picked three or four posts at random, ran them through different detectors, and my highest score was 18%. \n\n> 🦄 It’s not because I’m hiding anything or using some secret hack. **It’s the process.** \n\nI dictate most posts on the fly. Then I hand it off to the AI—to organize, to reword, sometimes to rewrite completely—but always under *my* set of rules. And it never, ever ends as a copy-paste job. I’m editing the whole time. There’s always a human—*me*—in the loop, every single time.\n\n---\n\n\n## 3. Will AI Improve Productivity? 🏃‍♀️\n\nSometimes. Sometimes Not. \n\nThere’s always a promise: AI will make you ten times faster, smarter, better, insert-your-buzzword-here. And maybe it’s true... _sometimes_. Documentation? Absolutely. I can roll out a draft in seconds—clean, organized, done. Drafting proposals? Don’t even get me started; I’m pretty sure the principals are getting sick of how fast I can toss together a pitch. \n\n> 😇 If they aren’t yet, give it time because I have more.\n\nBut sometimes AI just saves you from the jobs nobody wants. Like, digging through a decade’s worth of legacy code for a spike because it’s finally time to rebuild that app and nobody remembers what it's actually doing or why it was even there to begin with. \n\n> 🫤 I know _I_ don’t want to do that. _You_ don’t want to do that. **_Nobody_ wants to do that.** AI doesn't care and is pretty good at it! \n\nHonestly, sometimes it sees connections I might miss. But that doesn’t mean you can skip the whole process and trust whatever it finds. You still have to check. Maybe it saves you three days in the depths of the code mines, but **the human review isn’t optional.**\n\nStill, not every job should go to the bots, either. That gnarly production bug, that support ticket, the customer call—they all need a human. AI can be a superpower, but it’s not meant to replace the parts of your work that need actual judgment, empathy, or the magic of figuring it out together.\n\n---\n\n## 4. AI Is Not Bad (When You Use It Like a Pro) 👨‍🚀\n\nAI isn’t some villain lurking in your workflow. It’s a force multiplier. Used right, it makes your voice sharper and your edits faster—used wrong, it just adds to the noise.\n\nThat’s why every single commit I make defines exactly how much AI was involved and my posts are going to start wearing an “AI-Edited” badge. Not because someone told me to. Not as a disclaimer. **Because _somebody_ has to be willing to say there's a difference between generated and assisted.**\n\nThis is one version (and yes—Leonardo made them):\n\n![Human-Crafted && AI-Edited badge](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsdadww5m402rwyy355b.png)\n\n> 🦄 And if you want to use the badge yourself, or hand it off to a friend? Don’t copy this little screenshot—the full one (plus a couple others) are hanging out [in my repo](https://github.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/tree/gh-pages/human-ai-badges). Help yourself!\n\n---\n\n## 5. AI Code Is AI Content (Writers, You Too!) 💾\n\nHere’s my rule: disclosure, plain and simple:\n\n- Docs and posts: Add a simple footer like “This was generated with the help of AI tool.”\n- Code or technical writing: Commit with one of 3 different footers in the commit message:\n  - `Generated-with: AI tool` means AI did most or all of the work\n  - `Co-authored-by: AI tool` means the content is 50/50\n  - `Assisted-with: AI tool` means AI helped some, but not close to half\n\n> 💡 I started out using an email address in the commits, too — that _I thought_ I was making up—until some random app popped up as a contributor in my repo. _Not cool..._ 😒\n\nThis isn’t about checking boxes. It’s about giving credit, setting an example, and actually being transparent with yourself and the future people who end up needing it. \n\n> 😈 Besides, putting one more stamp on a long list of responsible AI use-cases puts a dent in the endless cycle of AI panic and the-world-is-ending doom speak.\n\n---\n\n## 6. And What About AI Images or Music? 🎨\n\nSame rules, different paint. Some artists pour weeks or months into training models on their own art. (I still haven’t managed to train mine and it's been over a month!) Others take the shortcut: punch in a sentence or two, let the AI “enhance” it, and call it done. \n\n> ❓ Are they copying someone’s style? I dunno—_maybe_? Should they? I honestly don’t know...\n\nSame applies here as does with writing: **artists absolutely have the right to protect their work.** But what does that look like, practically? Truth is we don’t really know yet. The laws are behind while the tech is still racing ahead. We’ll catch up. Maybe not soon enough, but eventually, we will.\n\n> 🦄 I just hope that when we get there, there’s at least _one person_ in the room who actually understands what’s happening—and what it looks like behind the scenes. **We absolutely need better laws,** but **we do not need people throwing broad rules at some conjured image of “AI training.”** Whatever it ends up being, honesty and fact need to come first.\n\n---\n\n\n## 7. Is AI “Stealing”? (No, but...) 🧬\n\nThis is where I dig in my heels. No, using AI-generated content is *not* stealing—*unless* you’re actively pretending someone else’s work is your own or ignoring copyright on purpose. However, “publicly available” isn’t the same as “public domain,” and **_nobody_ should lose credit for their work.**\n\nShould AI companies pay for certain data? Probably! Should writers and artists get a say? Of course. But “all AI is theft” is just as over-simplified as “all creators are saints.” \n\n> 🫡 Guess what? Real life and the world around us is messy—AI included. We need smarter laws, better tools, **and way less finger-pointing.**\n\n---\n\n### UPDATED \n\n{% embed https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/ %}\n\nThis is _brilliant_!

My beautiful schedule grew a crater where the testing window used to be, and from there it was just me, the agent, the caches, and a lot of swearing said lovingly at my own ambition. 🧭</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-whispernetwork-project-background\" href=\"#the-whispernetwork-project-background\">\n  </a>\n  The whisper-network: project background 📼\n</h2>\n\n<p>Late ’90s / early 2000s Georgia, when cell phones were for emergencies and you rationed the battery like it owed you money. My brother and I chased off-the-wall spots through a whisper network: backyard mini-festivals with passwords in the backs of free magazines, odd museums, ghost tours that were either hilariously fake or so real you quietly recalibrated your cosmology on the drive home. Too public and the cops came; too secret and the field stayed empty. We loved that balance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Underfoot</strong> bottles that energy. You give the resident <em>Stonewalker</em> an <strong>intent</strong> you actually feel (“live music,” “odd museums,” “strange gardens,” “spider farm”) plus a <strong>location</strong>. It crawls the not-obvious places first, normalizes the messy HTML, then returns a ranked list that says, “this is probably your kind of weird—go now.” 🕵️‍♀️</p>\n\n<p><strong>The “catch”:</strong> sometimes these events haven’t been discovered yet— that's how these things work. Besides, a chatbot can’t politely wait for scraping, so every <code>{intent, location}</code> pair sends out separate <strong>whispers</strong> that build the cache for that combo. The next person’s list is a little louder and a little wilder than the last. 🔁</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"i-cant-do-simple-and-i-stopped-pretending-otherwise\" href=\"#i-cant-do-simple-and-i-stopped-pretending-otherwise\">\n  </a>\n  I can’t do simple (and I stopped pretending otherwise) 🧶\n</h2>\n\n<p>I promise “tiny demo,” and five minutes later I have: an ADR (revised twice), a color palette in Leonardo, three caches, and a Future Enhancements page that looks like a subway map someone cried coffee onto. It’s not scope creep; it’s <strong>scope pre-planning</strong>. I need to see the whole creature to ship a slice.</p>\n\n<p>Vibe-coding lasted maybe two minutes. Copilot drafted the UI, I took a scenic (unnecessary) tour through Figma, flirted with Stitch, sprinted to <strong>n8n</strong> because hosted chat looked fast, missed my UI and dragged it back, and somewhere in there I wrote the agent I actually wanted—decisions like a product, not a science-fair trifold. 🧪</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-i-dont-do-hackathons-and-why-i-did-this-one-anyway\" href=\"#why-i-dont-do-hackathons-and-why-i-did-this-one-anyway\">\n  </a>\n  Why I don’t do hackathons (and why I did this one anyway) ⏱️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Hackathons want a snapshot; I build ecosystems. They want “Friday by midnight”; I want to label the stations, run one line today, and the others next week. I joined anyway because this is the exact agent I’ve wanted to build for months. It <em>was</em> fun—and it reminded me why trusting a green checkbox you don’t control is a dice roll. 🟩</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-it-looks-like-the-sprint-with-real-nouns\" href=\"#what-it-looks-like-the-sprint-with-real-nouns\">\n  </a>\n  What it looks like — the sprint with real nouns 🧵\n</h2>\n\n<p>Two mouths, one brain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>n8n Hosted Chat</strong> (discovered late, used constantly)</li>\n<li>A tiny <strong>Copilot-assisted React UI</strong> once I get this deployed and working the way it does in my head.

Reflex: vectors + RAG + tidy GCP attic. Reality: the clock. I did the boring, correct thing—<strong>pull less, trim sooner, cache earlier</strong>. Two caches unlocked; the third is a miniboss I’ll beat when I’m not running on midnight. 🧱</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"ai-agents-saints-on-monday-goblins-on-tuesday\" href=\"#ai-agents-saints-on-monday-goblins-on-tuesday\">\n  </a>\n  AI agents: saints on Monday, goblins on Tuesday 👾\n</h2>\n\n<p>Agents <em>in</em> the system and agents <em>helping</em> build the system—both truths can be true in the same hour:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>ChatGPT</strong> yanked me out of holes, then cited docs from a neighbor universe ten minutes later.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Copilot</strong> went license-dark mid-sprint—peak front-end day timing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leonardo</strong> kept momentum by letting me <em>see</em> the brand when the plumbing got gnarly.</li>\n<li>Various <strong>chat boxes</strong> (n8n, Bright Data, Supabase) were great rubber ducks until they hallucinated syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Rule that saved me:</strong> no agent writes straight to storage.

Simple lied. As soon as you care about de-dupe, TTLs, hit/miss tracking, and “please don’t melt anyone’s hobby site,” you need grown-up storage. I pivoted to <strong>Supabase</strong>, met <strong>Row-Level Security (RLS)</strong> and <strong>grants</strong> like a mini-boss in a fresh dungeon (v17 feels spicier), learned just enough to stop tripping over my new <code>underfoot</code> schema, and came out with two caches behaving—and a third that now knows the sound of my footsteps. 🪪</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"underfoot-belongs-in-your-pocket-laptops-were-the-proving-ground\" href=\"#underfoot-belongs-in-your-pocket-laptops-were-the-proving-ground\">\n  </a>\n  Underfoot belongs in your pocket (laptops were the proving ground) 📱\n</h2>\n\n<p>It runs on a computer because that’s where the tools live, but <strong>Underfoot is meant for your phone</strong>—a “you’re already out, what’s weird nearby?” companion. One-tap location, swipeable cards you can skim at a red light (responsibly), save/share that doesn’t fight you, and a quiet toggle: “nudge me when something odd appears within five miles.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Path:</strong> <strong>PWA now</strong> (installable, offline last results, Share Target) → <strong>push later</strong> (saved intents → “new oddities near you”) → <strong>Expo wrap</strong> with haptics and deep links like <code>underfoot://place/:id</code> so maps feel native. 🧭</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-i-did-wrong-say-it-out-loud\" href=\"#what-i-did-wrong-say-it-out-loud\">\n  </a>\n  What I did wrong (say it out loud) 🧨\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Trusted an external preload without a Plan B.</strong> The curated 2.3M rows never landed; my testing window vanished; I rewrote for “fetch + cache” and paid the polish tax. 🔌</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spent a half-day in Figma I couldn’t spare.</strong> Respect to UX; for me it was decorative quicksand. 🎨</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Let “Cloudflare will be easy” live rent-free.</strong> It wasn’t.

Update the prompt/flow to enforce cache → live tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cache management planning:</strong> I put a lot of design work into how the cache could be structured to allow for future RAG-type navigation, along with simpler embeds for straight vector search. However, I put zero thought (asides from \"I need to think about that at some point\") into actually managing it <em>after</em> the data is there. For now, it's all dependent on a merge that's unique by URL. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>That \"unique\" URL isn't very reliable and needs a better \"smart\" dedupe system</li>\n<li>I took a limited hour-ish aside through the land of TTL in Google Sheets (<em>not at all recommended</em>, by the way) and learned that any way I tried to make it work it always had the same result = <em>terrible idea</em>. That's how Supabase got involved, but ultimately broke things worse than fixing them. <strong>I probably should have left it alone.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Localization:</strong> right now it returns the first geocoder result for speed.

You give it a location and intent (music, coffee, hiking, spider farms…) and it returns unique results with a <strong>Stonewalker</strong> rating. Each query also adds anonymous <strong>whispers</strong> to the cache, so the dataset grows as people use it. 🎯</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/CheckMarKDevTools/underfoot-underground-travel-planner/\" class=\"ltag_cta ltag_cta--branded\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Repository — docs, flows, screenshots</a>\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://checkmarkdevtools.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/d92bc454-8f78-4471-ae25-ffa0c9bb87b3/chat\" class=\"ltag_cta ltag_cta--branded\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Underfoot Chat — The Stonewalker Agent (try it)</a>\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdyetwdzuuqouq39dsist.png%3Fv%3D2\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdyetwdzuuqouq39dsist.png%3Fv%3D2\" title=\"Underfoot / Stonewalker logo\" alt=\"Underfoot logo generated by Leonardo.ai and ChatGPT\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"underfoot-the-localsonly-treasure-hunter\" href=\"#underfoot-the-localsonly-treasure-hunter\">\n  </a>\n  Underfoot — the locals-only treasure hunter 🎒\n</h2>\n\n<p>I didn’t try to cram this into a weekend; I mapped two weeks like a flight plan. The part that snapped first was the one I trusted too much: a data preload that was “ready” on paper and nowhere in reality. My beautiful schedule grew a crater where the testing window used to be, and from there it was just me, the agent, the caches, and a lot of swearing said lovingly at my own ambition. 🧭</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-whispernetwork-project-background\" href=\"#the-whispernetwork-project-background\">\n  </a>\n  The whisper-network: project background 📼\n</h2>\n\n<p>Late ’90s / early 2000s Georgia, when cell phones were for emergencies and you rationed the battery like it owed you money. My brother and I chased off-the-wall spots through a whisper network: backyard mini-festivals with passwords in the backs of free magazines, odd museums, ghost tours that were either hilariously fake or so real you quietly recalibrated your cosmology on the drive home. Too public and the cops came; too secret and the field stayed empty. We loved that balance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Underfoot</strong> bottles that energy. You give the resident <em>Stonewalker</em> an <strong>intent</strong> you actually feel (“live music,” “odd museums,” “strange gardens,” “spider farm”) plus a <strong>location</strong>. It crawls the not-obvious places first, normalizes the messy HTML, then returns a ranked list that says, “this is probably your kind of weird—go now.” 🕵️‍♀️</p>\n\n<p><strong>The “catch”:</strong> sometimes these events haven’t been discovered yet— that's how these things work. Besides, a chatbot can’t politely wait for scraping, so every <code>{intent, location}</code> pair sends out separate <strong>whispers</strong> that build the cache for that combo. The next person’s list is a little louder and a little wilder than the last. 🔁</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"i-cant-do-simple-and-i-stopped-pretending-otherwise\" href=\"#i-cant-do-simple-and-i-stopped-pretending-otherwise\">\n  </a>\n  I can’t do simple (and I stopped pretending otherwise) 🧶\n</h2>\n\n<p>I promise “tiny demo,” and five minutes later I have: an ADR (revised twice), a color palette in Leonardo, three caches, and a Future Enhancements page that looks like a subway map someone cried coffee onto. It’s not scope creep; it’s <strong>scope pre-planning</strong>. I need to see the whole creature to ship a slice.</p>\n\n<p>Vibe-coding lasted maybe two minutes. Copilot drafted the UI, I took a scenic (unnecessary) tour through Figma, flirted with Stitch, sprinted to <strong>n8n</strong> because hosted chat looked fast, missed my UI and dragged it back, and somewhere in there I wrote the agent I actually wanted—decisions like a product, not a science-fair trifold. 🧪</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-i-dont-do-hackathons-and-why-i-did-this-one-anyway\" href=\"#why-i-dont-do-hackathons-and-why-i-did-this-one-anyway\">\n  </a>\n  Why I don’t do hackathons (and why I did this one anyway) ⏱️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Hackathons want a snapshot; I build ecosystems. They want “Friday by midnight”; I want to label the stations, run one line today, and the others next week. I joined anyway because this is the exact agent I’ve wanted to build for months. It <em>was</em> fun—and it reminded me why trusting a green checkbox you don’t control is a dice roll. 🟩</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-it-looks-like-the-sprint-with-real-nouns\" href=\"#what-it-looks-like-the-sprint-with-real-nouns\">\n  </a>\n  What it looks like — the sprint with real nouns 🧵\n</h2>\n\n<p>Two mouths, one brain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>n8n Hosted Chat</strong> (discovered late, used constantly)</li>\n<li>A tiny <strong>Copilot-assisted React UI</strong> once I get this deployed and working the way it does in my head.

Reflex: vectors + RAG + tidy GCP attic. Reality: the clock. I did the boring, correct thing—<strong>pull less, trim sooner, cache earlier</strong>. Two caches unlocked; the third is a miniboss I’ll beat when I’m not running on midnight. 🧱</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"ai-agents-saints-on-monday-goblins-on-tuesday\" href=\"#ai-agents-saints-on-monday-goblins-on-tuesday\">\n  </a>\n  AI agents: saints on Monday, goblins on Tuesday 👾\n</h2>\n\n<p>Agents <em>in</em> the system and agents <em>helping</em> build the system—both truths can be true in the same hour:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>ChatGPT</strong> yanked me out of holes, then cited docs from a neighbor universe ten minutes later.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Copilot</strong> went license-dark mid-sprint—peak front-end day timing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leonardo</strong> kept momentum by letting me <em>see</em> the brand when the plumbing got gnarly.</li>\n<li>Various <strong>chat boxes</strong> (n8n, Bright Data, Supabase) were great rubber ducks until they hallucinated syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Rule that saved me:</strong> no agent writes straight to storage.

Simple lied. As soon as you care about de-dupe, TTLs, hit/miss tracking, and “please don’t melt anyone’s hobby site,” you need grown-up storage. I pivoted to <strong>Supabase</strong>, met <strong>Row-Level Security (RLS)</strong> and <strong>grants</strong> like a mini-boss in a fresh dungeon (v17 feels spicier), learned just enough to stop tripping over my new <code>underfoot</code> schema, and came out with two caches behaving—and a third that now knows the sound of my footsteps. 🪪</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"underfoot-belongs-in-your-pocket-laptops-were-the-proving-ground\" href=\"#underfoot-belongs-in-your-pocket-laptops-were-the-proving-ground\">\n  </a>\n  Underfoot belongs in your pocket (laptops were the proving ground) 📱\n</h2>\n\n<p>It runs on a computer because that’s where the tools live, but <strong>Underfoot is meant for your phone</strong>—a “you’re already out, what’s weird nearby?” companion. One-tap location, swipeable cards you can skim at a red light (responsibly), save/share that doesn’t fight you, and a quiet toggle: “nudge me when something odd appears within five miles.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Path:</strong> <strong>PWA now</strong> (installable, offline last results, Share Target) → <strong>push later</strong> (saved intents → “new oddities near you”) → <strong>Expo wrap</strong> with haptics and deep links like <code>underfoot://place/:id</code> so maps feel native. 🧭</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-i-did-wrong-say-it-out-loud\" href=\"#what-i-did-wrong-say-it-out-loud\">\n  </a>\n  What I did wrong (say it out loud) 🧨\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Trusted an external preload without a Plan B.</strong> The curated 2.3M rows never landed; my testing window vanished; I rewrote for “fetch + cache” and paid the polish tax. 🔌</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spent a half-day in Figma I couldn’t spare.</strong> Respect to UX; for me it was decorative quicksand. 🎨</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Let “Cloudflare will be easy” live rent-free.</strong> It wasn’t. Keep the UI small; add a tiny Worker proxy only where needed. ☁️</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Left Copilot tied to work.</strong> Running out of credits mid-sprint felt like knitting with oven mitts. 🧤</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Underestimated n8n memory.</strong> Fixed by budgeting data like money: pull less, trim sooner, cache earlier. 🧮</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Structured output optimism.</strong> Agents <em>can</em> do it, but the normalizer must be the bouncer from hour one. 📇</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I still had a blast, learned a ton, and might even do it again—after a nap and a vacation from permissions dialogs. 🌙</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"future-plans-also-in-the-repo\" href=\"#future-plans-also-in-the-repo\">\n  </a>\n  Future plans (also in the repo) 🧱\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>High-impact next:</strong> dataset preload I control (seeded batches), vector search via pgvector once the pipeline is boring, Google Places (Text/Nearby + Details) through the same normalizer, and a curated “weird web” seed list (40–50 URLs you wouldn’t know to google, scheduled fetcher, quality scoring so the noisy ones get benched). 🧰</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cache-first response:</strong> the Whisper Network runs in the background, but the agent should <strong>hit the cache first</strong>. Update the prompt/flow to enforce cache → live tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cache management planning:</strong> I put a lot of design work into how the cache could be structured to allow for future RAG-type navigation, along with simpler embeds for straight vector search. However, I put zero thought (asides from \"I need to think about that at some point\") into actually managing it <em>after</em> the data is there. For now, it's all dependent on a merge that's unique by URL. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>That \"unique\" URL isn't very reliable and needs a better \"smart\" dedupe system</li>\n<li>I took a limited hour-ish aside through the land of TTL in Google Sheets (<em>not at all recommended</em>, by the way) and learned that any way I tried to make it work it always had the same result = <em>terrible idea</em>. That's how Supabase got involved, but ultimately broke things worse than fixing them. <strong>I probably should have left it alone.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Localization:</strong> right now it returns the first geocoder result for speed. Flesh this out so results match what people <em>meant</em>, not just what a geocoder guessed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Experience:</strong> transparent Stonewalker scoring you can peek and tweak; richer cards (images, tags, map snaps, save/share lists, quick filters); a quieter Discord bot that delivers value, not noise; mobile that respects thumbs and daylight. ✨</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Normalization 2.0 is the law; a tiny “repair” agent only when validation fails; better cross-source entity linking so “The Old Mill” is one place—not fourteen. 🔐</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"technical-stuff\" href=\"#technical-stuff\">\n  </a>\n  Technical Stuff\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>System Instructions:</strong> Stonewalker persona — hybrid nature/tech guide with a maps + travel focus.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model:</strong> GPT-4.1-mini (full model as backup).\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Memory/Cache:</strong> normalized results for reuse (v2.0); prototype began in Google Sheets.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Nodes:</strong> HTTP Request, Function (normalize/de-dupe), Discord notifier. <strong>Bright Data Verified</strong> node was great when it fit; I often swapped to plain HTTP for unusual flows.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central AI agent:</strong> <em>The Stonewalker.</em>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I had a separate data-only agent; it took too long for mediocre results.

      "body_markdown": "---\ntitle: Underfoot: The ChatPot for Hidden Places (and Why I Don’t Do Hackathons)\npublished: true\ndescription: My updated submission for the first hackathon I've done in more than 10 years—how it really happened.\ntags: [devchallenge, n8nbrightdatachallenge, ai, webdev]\ndescription: My updated submission for the first hackathon I've done in more than 10 years, here's how it really happened.\n---\n\n*This is a submission for the [AI Agents Challenge powered by n8n and Bright Data](https://dev.to/challenges/brightdata-n8n-2025-08-13).*\n\n## \\*\\*UPDATED\\*\\*\n\nI just noticed my n8n trial is officially expired 😢 So I've turned the chat back off so it doesn't seem like it _should_ be doing something. I have bigger plans for this guy though, so stay tuned. More updates from future me will follow. 🫶\n\n> Also, the \"prequel\" I wrote up a couple of days later. If you're curious about the whole \"no hackathons\" rule and want the _whole_ story, it's [here](https://dev.to/anchildress1/the-hackathon-i-swore-off-and-the-exhaustion-that-mostly-compiled-c4l).\n\n---\n\n> 🦄 **FYI:** I updated this after the fact—**I did plan two full weeks down to the minute**—but I didn’t plan for **not having the data** or **not having a solid backup** when it didn’t arrive. Also, I lost half a day to Figma’s decorative quicksand. The rushed thing I pasted to make the buzzer didn’t sound like me, so this is the version I can live with (and you can actually read for fun). 🪄\n\n---\n\n## What I Built\n\n**Underfoot** (my stubborn little **ChatPot**) is a chatbot that finds locals-only, off-the-map places you won’t see on Yelp or TripAdvisor. You give it a location and intent (music, coffee, hiking, spider farms…) and it returns unique results with a **Stonewalker** rating. Each query also adds anonymous **whispers** to the cache, so the dataset grows as people use it. 🎯\n\n{% cta https://github.com/CheckMarKDevTools/underfoot-underground-travel-planner/ %} GitHub Repository — docs, flows, screenshots {% endcta %}\n\n{% cta https://checkmarkdevtools.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/d92bc454-8f78-4471-ae25-ffa0c9bb87b3/chat %} Underfoot Chat — The Stonewalker Agent (try it) {% endcta %}\n\n![Underfoot logo generated by Leonardo.ai and ChatGPT](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dyetwdzuuqouq39dsist.png?v=2 \"Underfoot / Stonewalker logo\")\n\n---\n\n## Underfoot — the locals-only treasure hunter 🎒\n\nI didn’t try to cram this into a weekend; I mapped two weeks like a flight plan. The part that snapped first was the one I trusted too much: a data preload that was “ready” on paper and nowhere in reality. My beautiful schedule grew a crater where the testing window used to be, and from there it was just me, the agent, the caches, and a lot of swearing said lovingly at my own ambition. 🧭\n\n---\n\n## The whisper-network: project background 📼\n\nLate ’90s / early 2000s Georgia, when cell phones were for emergencies and you rationed the battery like it owed you money. My brother and I chased off-the-wall spots through a whisper network: backyard mini-festivals with passwords in the backs of free magazines, odd museums, ghost tours that were either hilariously fake or so real you quietly recalibrated your cosmology on the drive home. Too public and the cops came; too secret and the field stayed empty. We loved that balance.\n\n**Underfoot** bottles that energy. You give the resident _Stonewalker_ an **intent** you actually feel (“live music,” “odd museums,” “strange gardens,” “spider farm”) plus a **location**. It crawls the not-obvious places first, normalizes the messy HTML, then returns a ranked list that says, “this is probably your kind of weird—go now.” 🕵️‍♀️\n\n**The “catch”:** sometimes these events haven’t been discovered yet— that's how these things work. Besides, a chatbot can’t politely wait for scraping, so every `{intent, location}` pair sends out separate **whispers** that build the cache for that combo. The next person’s list is a little louder and a little wilder than the last. 🔁\n\n---\n\n## I can’t do simple (and I stopped pretending otherwise) 🧶\n\nI promise “tiny demo,” and five minutes later I have: an ADR (revised twice), a color palette in Leonardo, three caches, and a Future Enhancements page that looks like a subway map someone cried coffee onto. It’s not scope creep; it’s **scope pre-planning**. I need to see the whole creature to ship a slice.\n\nVibe-coding lasted maybe two minutes. Copilot drafted the UI, I took a scenic (unnecessary) tour through Figma, flirted with Stitch, sprinted to **n8n** because hosted chat looked fast, missed my UI and dragged it back, and somewhere in there I wrote the agent I actually wanted—decisions like a product, not a science-fair trifold. 🧪\n\n---\n\n## Why I don’t do hackathons (and why I did this one anyway) ⏱️\n\nHackathons want a snapshot; I build ecosystems. They want “Friday by midnight”; I want to label the stations, run one line today, and the others next week. I joined anyway because this is the exact agent I’ve wanted to build for months. It *was* fun—and it reminded me why trusting a green checkbox you don’t control is a dice roll. 🟩\n\n---\n\n## What it looks like — the sprint with real nouns 🧵\n\nTwo mouths, one brain:\n- **n8n Hosted Chat** (discovered late, used constantly)\n- A tiny **Copilot-assisted React UI** once I get this deployed and working the way it does in my head. I will update with this link too.\n\nBoth funnel free-form requests into `{ intent, location }`.\n\nThen:\n- **Fetch** from the non-mainstream first (Facebook events that behave, Reddit posts that map to places or pop-ups, a growing “weird web” list living in Obsidian).\n- **Parse** with minimal markup assumptions (HTML changes when you blink).\n- **De-dupe** with URL + fuzzy geo (and strip tracking sludge).\n- **Score** with the decimal **Stonewalker** blend: uniqueness • locality • recency • intent-fit.\n- **Cache** to **Supabase** (scraping the same planet twice is a sin).\n\nI hit **n8n’s memory ceiling** right when the first end-to-end run smiled at me. Reflex: vectors + RAG + tidy GCP attic. Reality: the clock. I did the boring, correct thing—**pull less, trim sooner, cache earlier**. Two caches unlocked; the third is a miniboss I’ll beat when I’m not running on midnight. 🧱\n\n---\n\n## AI agents: saints on Monday, goblins on Tuesday 👾\n\nAgents *in* the system and agents *helping* build the system—both truths can be true in the same hour:\n\n- **ChatGPT** yanked me out of holes, then cited docs from a neighbor universe ten minutes later.\n- **Copilot** went license-dark mid-sprint—peak front-end day timing.\n- **Leonardo** kept momentum by letting me *see* the brand when the plumbing got gnarly.\n- Various **chat boxes** (n8n, Bright Data, Supabase) were great rubber ducks until they hallucinated syntax.\n\n**Rule that saved me:** no agent writes straight to storage. The **normalizer** is the law. Drafts can be flammable; data cannot. 🧯\n\n---\n\n## The cache: Sheets vs Supabase (be a database, not a vibe) 🗄️\n\nI tried to keep the prototype in Google Sheets because it was there and felt simple. Simple lied. As soon as you care about de-dupe, TTLs, hit/miss tracking, and “please don’t melt anyone’s hobby site,” you need grown-up storage. I pivoted to **Supabase**, met **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and **grants** like a mini-boss in a fresh dungeon (v17 feels spicier), learned just enough to stop tripping over my new `underfoot` schema, and came out with two caches behaving—and a third that now knows the sound of my footsteps. 🪪\n\n---\n\n## Underfoot belongs in your pocket (laptops were the proving ground) 📱\n\nIt runs on a computer because that’s where the tools live, but **Underfoot is meant for your phone**—a “you’re already out, what’s weird nearby?” companion. One-tap location, swipeable cards you can skim at a red light (responsibly), save/share that doesn’t fight you, and a quiet toggle: “nudge me when something odd appears within five miles.”\n\n**Path:** **PWA now** (installable, offline last results, Share Target) → **push later** (saved intents → “new oddities near you”) → **Expo wrap** with haptics and deep links like `underfoot://place/:id` so maps feel native. 🧭\n\n---\n\n## What I did wrong (say it out loud) 🧨\n\n- **Trusted an external preload without a Plan B.** The curated 2.3M rows never landed; my testing window vanished; I rewrote for “fetch + cache” and paid the polish tax. 🔌\n- **Spent a half-day in Figma I couldn’t spare.** Respect to UX; for me it was decorative quicksand. 🎨\n- **Let “Cloudflare will be easy” live rent-free.** It wasn’t. Keep the UI small; add a tiny Worker proxy only where needed. ☁️\n- **Left Copilot tied to work.** Running out of credits mid-sprint felt like knitting with oven mitts. 🧤\n- **Underestimated n8n memory.** Fixed by budgeting data like money: pull less, trim sooner, cache earlier. 🧮\n- **Structured output optimism.** Agents *can* do it, but the normalizer must be the bouncer from hour one. 📇\n\n> 🦄 I still had a blast, learned a ton, and might even do it again—after a nap and a vacation from permissions dialogs. 🌙\n\n---\n\n## Future plans (also in the repo) 🧱\n\n**High-impact next:** dataset preload I control (seeded batches), vector search via pgvector once the pipeline is boring, Google Places (Text/Nearby + Details) through the same normalizer, and a curated “weird web” seed list (40–50 URLs you wouldn’t know to google, scheduled fetcher, quality scoring so the noisy ones get benched). 🧰\n\n**Cache-first response:** the Whisper Network runs in the background, but the agent should **hit the cache first**. Update the prompt/flow to enforce cache → live tools.\n\n**Cache management planning:** I put a lot of design work into how the cache could be structured to allow for future RAG-type navigation, along with simpler embeds for straight vector search. However, I put zero thought (asides from \"I need to think about that at some point\") into actually managing it _after_ the data is there. For now, it's all dependent on a merge that's unique by URL. \n\n  - That \"unique\" URL isn't very reliable and needs a better \"smart\" dedupe system\n  - I took a limited hour-ish aside through the land of TTL in Google Sheets (_not at all recommended_, by the way) and learned that any way I tried to make it work it always had the same result = _terrible idea_. That's how Supabase got involved, but ultimately broke things worse than fixing them. **I probably should have left it alone.**\n\n**Localization:** right now it returns the first geocoder result for speed. Flesh this out so results match what people *meant*, not just what a geocoder guessed.\n\n**Experience:** transparent Stonewalker scoring you can peek and tweak; richer cards (images, tags, map snaps, save/share lists, quick filters); a quieter Discord bot that delivers value, not noise; mobile that respects thumbs and daylight. ✨\n\n**Reliability:** Normalization 2.0 is the law; a tiny “repair” agent only when validation fails; better cross-source entity linking so “The Old Mill” is one place—not fourteen. 🔐\n\n---\n\n### Technical Stuff\n\n- **System Instructions:** Stonewalker persona — hybrid nature/tech guide with a maps + travel focus.  \n- **Model:** GPT-4.1-mini (full model as backup).  \n- **Memory/Cache:** normalized results for reuse (v2.0); prototype began in Google Sheets.  \n- **Nodes:** HTTP Request, Function (normalize/de-dupe), Discord notifier. **Bright Data Verified** node was great when it fit; I often swapped to plain HTTP for unusual flows.  \n- **Central AI agent:** *The Stonewalker.*  \n  - I had a separate data-only agent; it took too long for mediocre results. After cache reliability + maps data, I’ll revisit.  \n- **Triggers:** Webhook (custom UI) + n8n Chat (convenience).  \n- **Sources:** internal cache (in progress), Google Maps SERP (fallback), Google SERP, Reddit, Facebook events, pre-approved secondary sources (future).  \n- **Output:** structured parser + secondary normalizer.  \n  - I went back and forth on structured output; docs warn against strict schemas with agents. The normalizer stays the final authority.  \n- **Error handling:** Discord notifier—useful, loud; needs formatting + routing love.  \n- **Planned:** Bright Data Google Maps dataset *(delivered 2025-09-01 03:43 PDT — thanks, team).*  \n\n---\n\n## Screenshots 🖼️\n\n**Primary workflow**  \n![Flow overview diagram showing inputs, fetchers, parse/de-dupe, scoring, cache, and output](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pioe33oo4gswnut44su1.png?v=2 \"Flow overview — inputs → fetchers → parse/de-dupe → score → cache → output\")  \n\n**Last-minute solution instead of pre-cached data**  \n![Scraping Google Maps when the dataset didn't show](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a5t428t7n2sjnw8vr5yi.png?v=2 \"Google Maps fallback scraper\")  \n\n**Google SERP flow**  \n![Google search SERP workflow](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jh4p2ga2gtejtios5jzj.png?v=2 \"SERP workflow\")  \n\n**Reddit scraper**  \n![Reddit scraper workflow](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/goxp5giadgsuqvd5vesr.png \"Reddit scraper flow\")  \n\n**Facebook Events scraper**  \n![Facebook Events scraper](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wlaoxz5ain740sx4eo0i.png \"Facebook Events flow\")  \n\n**The Whisper Network (background caching)**  \n![The Whisper Network behind-the-scenes caching](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7qmvbb332a622t3js9te.png \"Whisper cache flow\")  \n\n**Discord notifications baked in**  \n![The annoying notifier that dinged every single time something went wrong](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gmd2hw3qop5ocxkkt53g.png \"Discord error notifier\")  \n\n---\n\n## Quick links 🔗\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/CheckMarKDevTools/underfoot-underground-travel-planner  \n**Live link:** https://checkmarkdevtools.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/d92bc454-8f78-4471-ae25-ffa0c9bb87b3/chat\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ R.A.I. — Responsible AI (how this stays good on purpose)\n\n- **Transparency:** model-generated text is obvious in context; ranked results cite sources; Stonewalker scores are explainable (uniqueness • locality • recency • intent-fit) with tunables coming. 🔍  \n- **Privacy:** no PII required; anonymous intent + coarse location only; one-click “forget me” clears local cache and server traces tied to your session. 🫥  \n- **Respect:** honor `robots.txt`, rate limits, and site TOS; prefer official APIs; link back, don’t lift; no paywalls or wholesale republishing. 🧑‍⚖️  \n- **Safety:** filter obviously harmful/illegal content and adult venues by default; opt-in gates for edgier categories; down-rank chains; spotlight genuinely local listings. 🧯  \n- **Hallucination guard:** agents don’t write to storage; a deterministic normalizer validates/repairs/rejects before anything lands; uncertainty is surfaced in the UI. 🧪  \n- **Security:** secrets live server-side; least-privilege keys; redacted logs; regular rotation. 🛡️  \n- **Crawl with manners:** staggered schedules, backoff, polite concurrency so nobody’s hobby site gets melted. 🐢  \n\n> 🦄 **Confession:** Yes I cheated — I let ChatGPT write the initial submission, which honestly I didn't even have time to read. There is no telling what was on it, but I know it _wasn't mine_ and it was making me crazy. 🤪 So please, **do not judge this writing** as part of whatever scoring happens with the project. It was all done _after_ the deadline.\n>\n> Last updated: 2025-09-01.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I know today is technically Copilot day, but honestly? I don't have space for another technical thought in my head right now. In case you missed it, I decided on a whim to submit <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/underfoot-the-chatpot-for-hidden-places-and-why-i-dont-do-hackathons-2684\">a project in the n8n/BrightData hackathon</a>. </p>\n\n<p>By itself, it's not saying much. But lifting a 10-year self-imposed hackathon ban is not a light thing for somebody whose version of all-in means every last ounce of everything I had was put into that one project over those two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>So instead of technical today, <strong>I've decided it's story time</strong> 😇 Welcome to my only <em>slightly</em> dramatized retelling of true events. I'll explain why I don't do hackathons plus the thing that ultimately changed my mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, pull up a chair. I’ll start at the beginning of the end.</strong> 🪑🎢</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"baby-bottles-and-fry-baskets\" href=\"#baby-bottles-and-fry-baskets\">\n  </a>\n  Baby Bottles and Fry Baskets 👶🍔\n</h2>\n\n<p>In 2008, my son was born. <strong>That was the time warp.</strong> Just a jump to the left, a step to the right, and suddenly my life wasn’t <em>mine</em> anymore. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>😵‍💫 Parenthood is the only <em>true</em> overnight shift. One day you’re yourself, the next you’re permanently on call for a 7lb CEO who screams about <em>everything</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At that point I was still sticking it out in restaurants — where I'd been for close to ten years. It was long hours, long drives, and I had very little to show for it. </p>\n\n<p>By January 2011, I was running on fumes and sheer force of will. <strong>Then the snowstorm hit.</strong> Everything was frozen, and there I was, <em>alone</em>, opening the restaurant. I ran the whole place myself: front line, back line, fry station, drive-thru, you-name-it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <em>\"Can't\"</em> has never been in my vocabulary. By all accounts I should have stayed home that day, but I wasn't about to let a little ice stop me from doing my job. The fact that I was alone was beyond my control. So I did what I knew to do, in any way I could make it happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>People were waiting at least thirty minutes, <em>minimum</em>, because one person can only move so fast, but the line just kept coming. At some point in the middle of that non-stop chaos, I looked up and saw my drive-thru customers standing inside. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🚦🤷‍♀️ Guess they’d been stuck out there long enough because before I knew what happened, a small group had collected in the lobby watching me sprint around like it was a personal comedy show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the moment, we made the best of it. We laughed, we joked, and I ran my ass off. Restaurants aren’t designed to run solo, but I made it work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That day I remember clearly</strong> — the day the rest of the world was shut down and I realized the joke was on me. There I was running a one-woman circus while everyone else got to stay home. </p>\n\n<p>I asked myself one question: <em>What exactly are you doing here?</em></p>\n\n<p>A few months later, <strong>I finally walked away, for good.</strong></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-student-loan-circus\" href=\"#the-student-loan-circus\">\n  </a>\n  The Student Loan Circus 🎓💸\n</h2>\n\n<p>That summer, I went back to school. Student loans as the <em>only</em> source of income — my lifeline. Most days, daycare covered things. Some days it didn’t.</p>\n\n<p>And there I was: the <em>older</em> student dragging a kid into class, <strong>existing in a universe completely separate from everyone else.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>👟 Their concerns were about parties and weekend plans. Mine were homework checks, missing shoes, and bills that didn’t pay themselves. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>That</em> was the dichotomy of my reality back then. My life just didn't fit into their box. But by junior or senior year, I’d settled into a rhythm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then came the group project.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The monster assignment. Sixty percent of the final grade hanging over all of us. The professor’s grand strategy? Hands up, step back, “do your thing.” <em>Great...</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Seriously, it was chaos dressed up as independence. Pick your projects, pick your teams, no submissions accepted after the deadline for <em>any</em> reason. I should have known hope was limited at that point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That’s when I suddenly became popular. The same people who’d barely looked my way all semester were now lining up to hitch their wagon to my grade. <strong>And of course, they wanted me to lead.</strong> Leadership wasn’t an issue — I’d been doing that for <em>years</em>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🤨 So y’all want me in charge? <em>Fine.</em> But here are the ground rules: I’m not guessing, we’re not bouncing dates around, and certain nights are simply not happening. We meet weekly. We get it done. We move on. Period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everyone nodded, even the professor (who I involved early on just in case things went sideways) gave me the “sounds good” approval. For a moment, I actually thought we had a workable agreement. <strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What followed was six weeks of circus hell. I brought calendars, agendas, timelines. They brought excuses. Too busy. Wrong night. Maybe later. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>😖 I've never been so amazed at people claiming to work! They shuffled meetings around like rearranging the board was the same thing as playing the game. And then acted like they deserved extra credit for their trouble.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>my reality lived in another universe</strong>: making sure homework got done, hunting down missing shoes, figuring out dinner on nights when the loans had already run dry.</p>\n\n<p>The gap between what they thought mattered and what I was actually carrying was ludicrous.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🤯 To this day, I still don’t know what half of them were even trying to say. All I knew was <em>project due</em> and <em>kid at home</em>. Anything beyond that simply didn't factor into the equation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-kicker\" href=\"#the-kicker\">\n  </a>\n  The Kicker 💥\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I thought <em>maybe</em> I could finally breathe, the peer reviews landed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Failure to communicate.</strong> <em>Really?</em> I had a plan mapped out since day one. Emails and group texts were constantly ignored, but somehow that's <em>my fault?</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Doesn’t work well with teams.</strong> Teams that don’t show up aren’t teams. At that point it’s just me, and if it’s me, I get it done. That’s the whole story.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can’t handle pressure.</strong> My favorite. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔥 You want pressure? I’ll let you babysit my kid, pay my bills, worry about classes and day care, and <em>then we’ll talk about pressure.</em></p>\n\n<p>The fact that your last-minute date took you away from the project? That’s not pressure. <em>That’s stupidity</em> and not my problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>I was livid.</strong> The immaturity was staggering. This was not the class I thought I’d signed up for.

One day you’re yourself, the next you’re permanently on call for a 7lb CEO who screams about <em>everything</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At that point I was still sticking it out in restaurants — where I'd been for close to ten years. It was long hours, long drives, and I had very little to show for it. </p>\n\n<p>By January 2011, I was running on fumes and sheer force of will. <strong>Then the snowstorm hit.</strong> Everything was frozen, and there I was, <em>alone</em>, opening the restaurant. I ran the whole place myself: front line, back line, fry station, drive-thru, you-name-it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <em>\"Can't\"</em> has never been in my vocabulary. By all accounts I should have stayed home that day, but I wasn't about to let a little ice stop me from doing my job. The fact that I was alone was beyond my control. So I did what I knew to do, in any way I could make it happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>People were waiting at least thirty minutes, <em>minimum</em>, because one person can only move so fast, but the line just kept coming. At some point in the middle of that non-stop chaos, I looked up and saw my drive-thru customers standing inside. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🚦🤷‍♀️ Guess they’d been stuck out there long enough because before I knew what happened, a small group had collected in the lobby watching me sprint around like it was a personal comedy show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the moment, we made the best of it. We laughed, we joked, and I ran my ass off. Restaurants aren’t designed to run solo, but I made it work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That day I remember clearly</strong> — the day the rest of the world was shut down and I realized the joke was on me. There I was running a one-woman circus while everyone else got to stay home. </p>\n\n<p>I asked myself one question: <em>What exactly are you doing here?</em></p>\n\n<p>A few months later, <strong>I finally walked away, for good.</strong></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-student-loan-circus\" href=\"#the-student-loan-circus\">\n  </a>\n  The Student Loan Circus 🎓💸\n</h2>\n\n<p>That summer, I went back to school. Student loans as the <em>only</em> source of income — my lifeline. Most days, daycare covered things. Some days it didn’t.</p>\n\n<p>And there I was: the <em>older</em> student dragging a kid into class, <strong>existing in a universe completely separate from everyone else.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>👟 Their concerns were about parties and weekend plans. Mine were homework checks, missing shoes, and bills that didn’t pay themselves. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>That</em> was the dichotomy of my reality back then. My life just didn't fit into their box. But by junior or senior year, I’d settled into a rhythm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then came the group project.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The monster assignment. Sixty percent of the final grade hanging over all of us. The professor’s grand strategy? Hands up, step back, “do your thing.” <em>Great...</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Seriously, it was chaos dressed up as independence. Pick your projects, pick your teams, no submissions accepted after the deadline for <em>any</em> reason. I should have known hope was limited at that point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That’s when I suddenly became popular. The same people who’d barely looked my way all semester were now lining up to hitch their wagon to my grade. <strong>And of course, they wanted me to lead.</strong> Leadership wasn’t an issue — I’d been doing that for <em>years</em>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🤨 So y’all want me in charge? <em>Fine.</em> But here are the ground rules: I’m not guessing, we’re not bouncing dates around, and certain nights are simply not happening. We meet weekly. We get it done. We move on. Period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everyone nodded, even the professor (who I involved early on just in case things went sideways) gave me the “sounds good” approval. For a moment, I actually thought we had a workable agreement. <strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What followed was six weeks of circus hell. I brought calendars, agendas, timelines. They brought excuses. Too busy. Wrong night. Maybe later. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>😖 I've never been so amazed at people claiming to work! They shuffled meetings around like rearranging the board was the same thing as playing the game. And then acted like they deserved extra credit for their trouble.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>my reality lived in another universe</strong>: making sure homework got done, hunting down missing shoes, figuring out dinner on nights when the loans had already run dry.</p>\n\n<p>The gap between what they thought mattered and what I was actually carrying was ludicrous.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🤯 To this day, I still don’t know what half of them were even trying to say. All I knew was <em>project due</em> and <em>kid at home</em>. Anything beyond that simply didn't factor into the equation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-kicker\" href=\"#the-kicker\">\n  </a>\n  The Kicker 💥\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I thought <em>maybe</em> I could finally breathe, the peer reviews landed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Failure to communicate.</strong> <em>Really?</em> I had a plan mapped out since day one. Emails and group texts were constantly ignored, but somehow that's <em>my fault?</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Doesn’t work well with teams.</strong> Teams that don’t show up aren’t teams. At that point it’s just me, and if it’s me, I get it done. That’s the whole story.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Can’t handle pressure.</strong> My favorite. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔥 You want pressure? I’ll let you babysit my kid, pay my bills, worry about classes and day care, and <em>then we’ll talk about pressure.</em></p>\n\n<p>The fact that your last-minute date took you away from the project? That’s not pressure. <em>That’s stupidity</em> and not my problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>I was livid.</strong> The immaturity was staggering. This was not the class I thought I’d signed up for. So I marched back to the professor — the same one who’d nodded at my ground rules like they were gospel — expecting backup.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I got a <em>“solution.”</em> Maybe, he suggested, I should try a group activity. 🤯😱🤬</p>\n\n<p><strong>Translation: hackathon.</strong></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-hackathon-i-swore-off\" href=\"#the-hackathon-i-swore-off\">\n  </a>\n  The Hackathon I Swore Off 🍕💻\n</h2>\n\n<p>A hackathon?

There I was running a one-woman circus while everyone else got to stay home. \n \nI asked myself one question: _What exactly are you doing here?_\n\nA few months later, **I finally walked away, for good.**\n\n---\n\n## The Student Loan Circus 🎓💸\n\nThat summer, I went back to school. Student loans as the _only_ source of income — my lifeline. Most days, daycare covered things. Some days it didn’t.\n\nAnd there I was: the _older_ student dragging a kid into class, **existing in a universe completely separate from everyone else.** \n\n> 👟 Their concerns were about parties and weekend plans. Mine were homework checks, missing shoes, and bills that didn’t pay themselves. \n\n_That_ was the dichotomy of my reality back then. My life just didn't fit into their box. But by junior or senior year, I’d settled into a rhythm.\n\n\n**Then came the group project.**\n\nThe monster assignment. Sixty percent of the final grade hanging over all of us. The professor’s grand strategy? Hands up, step back, “do your thing.” _Great..._\n\n> 🦄 Seriously, it was chaos dressed up as independence. Pick your projects, pick your teams, no submissions accepted after the deadline for _any_ reason. I should have known hope was limited at that point.\n\n---\n\nThat’s when I suddenly became popular. The same people who’d barely looked my way all semester were now lining up to hitch their wagon to my grade. **And of course, they wanted me to lead.** Leadership wasn’t an issue — I’d been doing that for _years_. \n\n> 🤨 So y’all want me in charge? _Fine._ But here are the ground rules: I’m not guessing, we’re not bouncing dates around, and certain nights are simply not happening. We meet weekly. We get it done. We move on. Period.\n\nEveryone nodded, even the professor (who I involved early on just in case things went sideways) gave me the “sounds good” approval. For a moment, I actually thought we had a workable agreement. **I was wrong.**\n\n---\n\nWhat followed was six weeks of circus hell. I brought calendars, agendas, timelines. They brought excuses. Too busy. Wrong night. Maybe later. \n\n> 😖 I've never been so amazed at people claiming to work! They shuffled meetings around like rearranging the board was the same thing as playing the game. And then acted like they deserved extra credit for their trouble.\n\nMeanwhile, **my reality lived in another universe**: making sure homework got done, hunting down missing shoes, figuring out dinner on nights when the loans had already run dry.\n\nThe gap between what they thought mattered and what I was actually carrying was ludicrous.  \n\n> 🤯 To this day, I still don’t know what half of them were even trying to say. All I knew was _project due_ and _kid at home_. Anything beyond that simply didn't factor into the equation.\n\n---\n\n## The Kicker 💥\n\nWhen I thought _maybe_ I could finally breathe, the peer reviews landed:\n\n- **Failure to communicate.** _Really?_ I had a plan mapped out since day one. Emails and group texts were constantly ignored, but somehow that's _my fault?_\n- **Doesn’t work well with teams.** Teams that don’t show up aren’t teams. At that point it’s just me, and if it’s me, I get it done. That’s the whole story.\n- **Can’t handle pressure.** My favorite. \n\n> 🔥 You want pressure? I’ll let you babysit my kid, pay my bills, worry about classes and day care, and _then we’ll talk about pressure._\n> \n> The fact that your last-minute date took you away from the project? That’s not pressure. _That’s stupidity_ and not my problem.\n\n**I was livid.** The immaturity was staggering. This was not the class I thought I’d signed up for. So I marched back to the professor — the same one who’d nodded at my ground rules like they were gospel — expecting backup.\n\nInstead, I got a _“solution.”_ Maybe, he suggested, I should try a group activity. 🤯😱🤬\n\n**Translation: hackathon.**\n\n---\n\n## The Hackathon I Swore Off 🍕💻  \n\nA hackathon? Because obviously the cure for dealing with people who never show up is to lock me in a room with them for forty-eight hours straight. _Brilliant._\n\n**But this wasn’t optional.** Those peer reviews weren’t _just comments_, they were baked into the grade. My arguments didn’t matter. \n\n> 😑 Agree or not, I had to make up for the fact that my so-called “team” — that useless cluster of hangers-on and deadweights — had _once again_ barged into my life and left me holding the bag.\n\nAnd the price this time was a whole weekend I didn’t have to spare.\n\n---\n\n**So I did it.** Two days in the lab, stale pizza boxes stacked like trophies, Mountain Dew flowing like tap water. The twenty-year-olds bounced around as if sleep was optional, while I was counting babysitting hours like poker chips and wondering how many cups of coffee equal a nap.\n\n> 🌪️ It was sheer chaos, and not the good kind.\n\nI got to know people, sure, maybe even understood them a little better. But I was exhausted and my price was sitting at home without me while I watched people bluff their way through the night.\n\nBy the end I could barely remember my own name. **And I walked out swearing: _never again_.** Not unless I could give it one hundred percent — which I knew I couldn’t, not while a six-year-old still needed me every moment of every day.\n\n---\n\n## Until Now 🔄⏳  \n\nFast-forward to 2025. My son’s grown, living with his dad, and for the first time in nearly twenty years, I have time that actually _belongs to me_. Then along comes this challenge: n8n, agents, scrapers — basically my bucket list wrapped in one neat little package.  \n\n**So I broke my rule.** WakaTime says I spent more than a hundred hours in two weeks, and that doesn’t even count the black hole of time lost to the n8n UI — or my day job that doesn’t allow time off for my randomness (no matter how forgiving they are of my standups). Nights bled into four-thirty in the morning. Work still started at nine. Weekends turned into catch-up lies I told myself to feel better.\n\n> 🎨 I coded until my brain short-circuited, then wandered off to Leonardo to play with color because apparently sleep deprivation makes me an artist.\n\n---\n\nThat’s the thing about hackathons: they chew you up. The clock never stops, and you’re not polishing anything — it’s MVP or bust. The urge to overbuild doesn’t go away, but the deadline keeps you honest. \n\nAnd the prize money? Forget it. If that’s your motivation, just get a job. At least those checks clear. The real payoff is the exhaustion you somehow enjoy, the kind where you know you emptied the tank and came out standing anyway. \n\n> 🫩 So yeah, I’m wrecked and my brain owes me four days of sleep.  \n\nBut unlike that overnight hackathon years ago, I didn’t walk away muttering “never again.” This time I realized I’d come full circle. Back then, the rule was survival. With a kid, student loans, and no margin for error, I couldn’t afford to burn myself out for fun.  \n\n**Now, I finally could.** And it turns out I didn’t just survive it — I loved it. 💟\n\n---\n\n## When Survival Turns Into Choice 🧭\n\nAnd maybe that’s the truth hiding in all of this: _“never again”_ usually just means _“not right now.”_\n\nIt’s okay to slam the door shut, to swear something off loudly enough that everyone hears you — **sometimes that’s survival.** But don’t be surprised when the same thing comes knocking again years later.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe the next time it shows up, it brings something a little different with it. 🫶\n\n---\n\n{% embed http://dev.to/anchildress1 %}  \n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Responsible AI Statement (RAI)\n\nThis post was drafted with the assistance of AI.

So a little late, but I wanted to share. You tell me — <em>am I the crazy one here?</em> 🫤</p>\n\n<p>👆 Also, River has shown up in a few posts already — the Leonardo reimagining of my blog character. She’s still missing some key features (training tokens are tapped out until the month resets), but you get the idea. 😆 Expect a couple more tweaks coming soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Friday was my chill day (rare, but they do happen) and I noticed somebody had followed me on Medium. Which is funny, because I’d already canceled my membership — it just hadn’t expired yet. Five bucks a month isn’t exactly breaking the bank, so I thought, fine, maybe I’ll toss a few posts over there alongside LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>That <em>was</em> the plan. Until I landed on Medium’s homepage and saw this headline:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/blog/we-want-your-feedback-how-can-writers-use-ai-to-tell-human-stories-eb9dee926f2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“We want your feedback: how can writers use AI to tell human stories?”</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Perfect hook, right? Except two scrolls later I was fuming like I was just called in for a rollback on a Friday night. 😡</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-fine-print\" href=\"#the-fine-print\">\n  </a>\n  The Fine Print 🔍\n</h2>\n\n<p>By the time you dig through the post, the documentation, and the linked policies, the message is clear:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AI as spellcheck? Totally fine. ✅ </li>\n<li>ChatGPT outlines and fact-checks? Approved. ✅ </li>\n<li>Anything more (drafting, editing, all other AI assistance)? ❌ \n\n<ul>\n<li>You’re officially outside their definition of “writer.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>And if you <em>do</em> dare use AI, you have to declare it at the very top of your post, within the first two paragraphs, and again on every image. Metadata doesn’t count.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you lean on AI for anything beyond grammar, you can write on Medium, but you’ll never get boosted, partnered, or featured.

Nobody wants a feed full of unedited AI sludge. I’m not trying to game the system either. I’m not chasing claps or badges. I write because it’s fun, because I need a break from code, and because I have opinions the world clearly needs to hear. 😉 </p>\n\n<p><strong>AI doesn’t erase my voice — it sharpens it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So calling everything in between spellcheck and prompt-posting off limits? No appeal, no nuance, just blanket exclusion? <em>That’s</em> where I’m lost.</p>\n\n<p>Developers talk nonstop about AI. Colleges too. It’s a huge, messy, <strong>important conversation</strong>. And Medium — the site that prides itself on being the “top blogging platform” — takes the most stereotypical, exclusionary stance possible. ChatGPT usually gets painted as the villain here, but really, it’s just the stand-in for all the tools that make the work easier.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, it feels less like quality control and more like gatekeeping.

Just in case anyone’s wondering how the whole process actually happens, here it is - step by step:</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>ONE. <strong>Idea</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I’ll literally have no idea what I'm going to talk about until I actually start writing. Other times, I’ve been saving ideas for weeks! There’s really no rhyme or reason to this, so I just go with it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seems like now that I'm actually in a groove, these \"off-the-usual-topic\" (read <em>Copilot</em>) posts are more frequent, too. 🏎️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>TWO. <strong>Draft</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IS 100% ME</strong> - sometimes I’m lazy and will dictate to ChatGPT (occasionally Gemini, but we’re on a hiatus right now anyway), but I have an instruction that says specifically do not change anything until I tell you I’m ready to start editing. </p>\n\n<p>So for the majority of the week (and more-than-occasionally late the night before 🤐) I’m working on a relatively cohesive unit to cover a specific <em>something</em> (\"topic\" is usually a stretch, at this point). Typically, the draft version is roughly twice as long as the final version and my posts aren’t exactly short to begin with (I know).</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>THREE. <strong>Edits</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this is where it gets a <em>little tricky</em>. I have a custom set of instructions for the blog posts, in which the majority of it is focused on two major things, in order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scan the entire post and make changes wherever needed to remove <strong>unintentional bias</strong>, and for every change you make, summarize it with examples and <strong>show me</strong> why your version is better suited. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m getting better as we go, but it’s really just a safety net so I don’t accidentally put my foot in my mouth after taking the scenic route to my point (it’s a talent).  📸</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep my <strong>original attitude and quirks</strong> as much as possible, but not to the extent that it contradicts the first point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I already trained it a long time ago to censor me. It doesn’t even bring that part up anymore, most of the time anyway. 😶 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FOUR. <strong>Negotiation</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really don’t have a better word for what happens during this phase, because that’s exactly what it feels like. ChatGPT took my nice story and turned it into something that I only vaguely recognize, so I’ll argue that it’s <em>TOO</em> changed. </p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT argues with me that not everybody understands what a \"holler\" is and that it’s probably already too far off-topic to explain whatever contextual point I wanted to make anyway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's usually accurate, too. 😤</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FIVE. <strong>Final polish</strong></p>\n\n<p>After we have a <em>final working version</em> (cause I’m still changing it randomly), the quizzing starts for all those words I want to say, but really just cannot put my finger on or I need to convey some sort of emotion or attitude (and I’m getting sick of seeing the same emojis all the time).</p>\n\n<p>This is where the content of the blog conversation in ChatGPT pivots and I’ll have it show me a random 10 emojis that could work for a particular phrase or scenario - I’ll pick from there. Same with section titles and quotes, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💿 When it comes to titles, quotes, and references - it's rarely as simple as <strong>picking one</strong> from a list. Most of the time, I'll pick parts of at least three and then feed them back to ChatGPT to make coherent again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SIX. <strong>Final review</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point it’s all loaded into Dev, but I'm still reviewing repeatedly until I can make it from top to bottom without the urge to change something immediately (which can sometimes take a couple days - like this post ⚡️). </p>\n\n<p>There’s typically a whole lot of page swapping (preview &gt; edit &gt; preview) until I’m finally happy with the overall version. From there, most posts get scheduled for Wednesday mornings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪴 Why? No reason, really - it’s more random chance. I’ve tried to stay on at least a weekly schedule since I joined. If I schedule the big posts, I know I won’t accidentally miss a day. 😇</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SEVEN. <strong>Update: RAI Footer</strong></p>\n\n<p>So here’s a late-breaking update: After I stumbled onto a post over on Medium (for reasons I still can’t fully explain 🙄), I decided to forward some of these posts there too. Turns out, Medium has a whole policy on “AI-generated” content — because <em>of course</em> they do. And since I can never resist at a good debate, let’s be extra clear about how these work.</p>\n\n<p>Those “RAI Footers” you see at the end of each post? They’re mostly the work of ChatGPT now, spun up from my own pile of instructions. </p>\n\n<p>The usual ask:<br>\n<code>Take the main theme of this post and add a unique, fun way to say that you (the AI) helped make it happen.</code></p>\n\n<p>I always review and edit for good measure, but honestly, after ChatGPT does all the heavy lifting, it’s only fair it gets its own section. This is the AI-generated section, after all. Seems only right to give the robot its moment in the spotlight. 🎩</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"tldr-the-heart-of-the-matter\" href=\"#tldr-the-heart-of-the-matter\">\n  </a>\n  TL;DR: The Heart of the Matter 🫀\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve made it this far, now you know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, I use AI - a LOT</li>\n<li>No, it doesn’t do <em>all</em> the work for me</li>\n<li>Yes, I argue with it (and sometimes lose...)</li>\n<li>No, it hasn’t taken over my personality</li>\n<li>Yes, the cover art is AI-generated\n\n<ul>\n<li>unless it’s truly hideous - those are locked in the vault!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The real secret is that all of this is <em>still me</em>!

      "body_markdown": "> The cover image is a result of me getting very impatient with ChatGPT after the third **nearly perfect** cover of some random stranger that was supposed to be me. So, I'm yelling, \"that's definitely not my face!\" and ChatGPT insists theres a resemblance (there's not). It didn't take much for me to give up and upload a real picture, as a guide.\n>\n>🦄 **Spoiler:** The very next one was a total disaster, but the last attempt? Not half bad! 🤣\n\n---\n\nAt some point during the day yesterday, I was working on a project and talking to a friend about the whole AI “thing” (that’s the new technical word for it, by the way 🤩). Then out of nowhere, it dawned on me... I’m pretty positive that I don’t have a **single** post with the sort of footer/disclaimer that I’ve been preaching about for weeks, to anyone who would listen to me. 🤦‍♀️\n\n> You guys have got off easy (so far) - but some of the folks at work, I’m sure, were _thrilled_ about the weekend! Don’t worry, guys, _me too_... me too. 😮\n\nSo, since I’ve made a point to go back and add a disclaimer to every post thus far, I decided to take a quick minute to explain what that **really** means - in case anyone is curious.\n\n---\n\n## All the Ways I Let Robots Help 📡\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nYou probably guessed already - this is my primary AI for all things coding, but since their premium limits went into permanent effect on June 18th, I’ve been doing good to break even just with work. I’ll share what part’s have actually been working at some point, but so far the answer is \"not a lot\".\n\n> I have some ideas, so it's not a lost cause yet! For now though, I'm hovering right around 67% usage and work might actually cut me off if I don't make it to the end of the month 👿\n\n---\n\n### Codex\n\nSince I already have an OpenAI subscription, I’ve been tinkering with Codex as a potential solution to the lack of premium requests 😱😭 We’ll see how it goes.\n\n> I’m _trying_ to give it a fair chance... The **good news** in all this? You remember in my [nightmare story](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh) I mentioned doing some pretty out-there things to get my hands on the enterprise version of the Copilot license? Well, apparently, if you exhaust 100% of your premium requests in less than 4 days _AND_ make sure your boss is _instantly_ aware of the problem - you know, so they understand the **true gravity** of the matter in real-time (which is around 7 PM on a Saturday) - work is suddenly more willing to share 😇 \n\n---\n\n### ChatGPT\n\nI’ve been a long-time user for quite some time, but I wanted to call this guy out - and more specifically, exactly _how_ ChatGPT is involved in all my posts. While Copilot is the topic of most everything I write, ChatGPT is usually busy behind the scenes.\n\n> 🦄 Don’t worry, I’m sure the obsession will wear off eventually... maybe... oh hell, probably not. Never mind! 😅\n\n---\n\n### Gemini\n\nGemini and I aren’t talking much right now - which has everything to do with the beta install I put on my Android before fully realizing what Google had _actually_ done with all the hands-free tools the non-generative assistant used to handle (spoiler: not a damn thing is the answer 😡). So, for now, Gemini’s riding the bench.\n\n> I’m sure that won’t last long. Google might be trailing OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI game, but I’ve never known them to stay at the back of the pack. 🛸\n\n---\n\n##  The (Messy) Human-AI Creative Process 🕹️\n\n### Cover art\n\nThat one is easy to guess. I’ve almost perfected a prompt that will keep the primary image content vertically \"squished\" towards the center, so the aspect ratio will match suggested size guidelines after I crop it.\n\n> Today's image is a test in full-size, but it was to good to mess with much, especially considering all the personalities it gave me along the way. 🥸\n\n- Seems like either all of the training data was a perfect square OR more likely it's been trained to output specific sizes and my attempts at a compromise violate that plan.\n\n- I have a designated project for the banner images and roughly half the time I give it a prompt and just use whatever it spits out at me. The other half, it’s either not at all usable or it’s _so terrible_ I really don’t want to share it.\n\n> It will take some work for me to go through those, but yes - I at least save them. 🔒\n\n- Gimp isn’t AI, but it's my go-to for anything image related. Up until a little bit ago I **thought** I was saving all images with meta tags that included the “Generated by/Edited with” comment, but either it’s just different on this computer or they’re not really being saved like I thought. \n\n> I’m gonna work on that before next post though - those should definitely be there! 🏁\n\n---\n\n### Blog posts 💬\n\nI’m not about to let AI write the _whole thing_ for me (where’s the fun in that?), but I do rely on it a lot for drafts and edits. Just in case anyone’s wondering how the whole process actually happens, here it is - step by step:\n\n---\n\nONE. **Idea**\n\nSometimes I’ll literally have no idea what I'm going to talk about until I actually start writing. Other times, I’ve been saving ideas for weeks! There’s really no rhyme or reason to this, so I just go with it. \n\n> Seems like now that I'm actually in a groove, these \"off-the-usual-topic\" (read _Copilot_) posts are more frequent, too. 🏎️\n\n---\n\nTWO. **Draft**\n\n**IS 100% ME** - sometimes I’m lazy and will dictate to ChatGPT (occasionally Gemini, but we’re on a hiatus right now anyway), but I have an instruction that says specifically do not change anything until I tell you I’m ready to start editing. \n\nSo for the majority of the week (and more-than-occasionally late the night before 🤐) I’m working on a relatively cohesive unit to cover a specific _something_ (\"topic\" is usually a stretch, at this point). Typically, the draft version is roughly twice as long as the final version and my posts aren’t exactly short to begin with (I know).\n\n---\n\nTHREE. **Edits**\n\nSo this is where it gets a _little tricky_. I have a custom set of instructions for the blog posts, in which the majority of it is focused on two major things, in order:\n\n- Scan the entire post and make changes wherever needed to remove **unintentional bias**, and for every change you make, summarize it with examples and **show me** why your version is better suited. \n    \n> I’m getting better as we go, but it’s really just a safety net so I don’t accidentally put my foot in my mouth after taking the scenic route to my point (it’s a talent).  📸\n\n- Keep my **original attitude and quirks** as much as possible, but not to the extent that it contradicts the first point.\n    \n> I already trained it a long time ago to censor me. It doesn’t even bring that part up anymore, most of the time anyway. 😶 \n\n---\n\nFOUR. **Negotiation**\n\nI really don’t have a better word for what happens during this phase, because that’s exactly what it feels like. ChatGPT took my nice story and turned it into something that I only vaguely recognize, so I’ll argue that it’s _TOO_ changed. \n\nChatGPT argues with me that not everybody understands what a \"holler\" is and that it’s probably already too far off-topic to explain whatever contextual point I wanted to make anyway.\n      \n> It's usually accurate, too. 😤\n\n---\n\nFIVE. **Final polish**\n\nAfter we have a _final working version_ (cause I’m still changing it randomly), the quizzing starts for all those words I want to say, but really just cannot put my finger on or I need to convey some sort of emotion or attitude (and I’m getting sick of seeing the same emojis all the time).\n\nThis is where the content of the blog conversation in ChatGPT pivots and I’ll have it show me a random 10 emojis that could work for a particular phrase or scenario - I’ll pick from there. Same with section titles and quotes, too.\n\n> 💿 When it comes to titles, quotes, and references - it's rarely as simple as **picking one** from a list. Most of the time, I'll pick parts of at least three and then feed them back to ChatGPT to make coherent again.\n\n---\n\nSIX. **Final review**\n\nAt this point it’s all loaded into Dev, but I'm still reviewing repeatedly until I can make it from top to bottom without the urge to change something immediately (which can sometimes take a couple days - like this post ⚡️). \n\nThere’s typically a whole lot of page swapping (preview > edit > preview) until I’m finally happy with the overall version. From there, most posts get scheduled for Wednesday mornings.\n\n> 🪴 Why? No reason, really - it’s more random chance. I’ve tried to stay on at least a weekly schedule since I joined. If I schedule the big posts, I know I won’t accidentally miss a day. 😇\n\n---\n\nSEVEN. **Update: RAI Footer**\n\nSo here’s a late-breaking update: After I stumbled onto a post over on Medium (for reasons I still can’t fully explain 🙄), I decided to forward some of these posts there too. Turns out, Medium has a whole policy on “AI-generated” content — because _of course_ they do. And since I can never resist at a good debate, let’s be extra clear about how these work.\n\nThose “RAI Footers” you see at the end of each post? They’re mostly the work of ChatGPT now, spun up from my own pile of instructions. \n\nThe usual ask:\n`Take the main theme of this post and add a unique, fun way to say that you (the AI) helped make it happen.`\n\nI always review and edit for good measure, but honestly, after ChatGPT does all the heavy lifting, it’s only fair it gets its own section. This is the AI-generated section, after all. Seems only right to give the robot its moment in the spotlight. 🎩\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR: The Heart of the Matter 🫀\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, now you know:\n\n- Yes, I use AI - a LOT\n- No, it doesn’t do _all_ the work for me\n- Yes, I argue with it (and sometimes lose...)\n- No, it hasn’t taken over my personality\n- Yes, the cover art is AI-generated\n  - unless it’s truly hideous - those are locked in the vault!\n\n> The real secret is that all of this is _still me_!

They’d worked fine across several projects — until I broke them out into separate modules. Suddenly, Copilot switched from helpful answers to just summarizing its entire conversation history, no matter what I asked. 😡🤷‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>So I went back to basics, commenting out nearly everything in the prompt and adding back small sections one at a time. Eventually, I found the culprit: a single instruction forcing Copilot to re-read its whole history, flooding the context window and making it summarize the past instead of the changes. 😵‍💫</p>\n\n<p>Even after finding the strange trigger, I didn’t really understand <em>why</em> it broke things. Cue ChatGPT’s helpful “explain like I’m five” walkthrough of what was happening behind the scenes (later confirmed with Copilot’s debug logs). Once I removed that one line, everything worked like normal again. 🌈</p>\n\n<p>And that’s the <em>real</em> lesson: Copilot — or any AI assistant — is just another tool in your toolbox. When it starts acting up or giving weird results, don’t panic. Debug it the same way you’d debug any stubborn code or logic bug: one step at a time. 😉</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"metaoptimize-your-prompts\" href=\"#metaoptimize-your-prompts\">\n  </a>\n  Meta-Optimize Your Prompts 🤖🤝🤖\n</h2>\n\n<p>Still not satisfied?

Before you go on a prompt-fixing spree, try these quick checks first:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Truth bomb:</strong> 99% of Copilot “failures” are just crummy (or missing) repo instructions. Don’t believe me? Treat it like the “Copilot Easter Egg Hunt”: if you run into a prompt problem you genuinely can’t solve, drop it in the comments. If you actually stump me, you’ll get full bragging rights — and I’ll spotlight your curveball (and, if I crack it, share the fix) in a future post. Nine times out of ten, though? Tweak your instructions and the problem disappears.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\" alt=\"divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"stuck-try-these-quick-fixes\" href=\"#stuck-try-these-quick-fixes\">\n  </a>\n  Stuck? Try These Quick Fixes 🪤\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Check Your Input:</strong> Is your question <em>actually</em> clear? Would your past self, or a random teammate, know exactly what you mean? If not, rewrite your ask with a little more context or supply explicit examples.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ask Copilot to Explain:</strong> Use Copilot’s “explain this code” or similar command on your prompt, not your code. What does it think you want? If it’s wildly off, break it down into smaller sections and review each one at a time.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Review Repo Instructions:</strong> Open your <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> file and just read it <em>out loud</em>. Does it make sense, or does it sound like a jumbled set of copy-paste rules? Most issues start here!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Start With Defaults:</strong> <em>Temporarily</em> comment out all your custom instructions and use a “vanilla” Copilot prompt. Is the result better, worse, or just... different? This is a simple way to isolate and test if your changes are helping or hurting. Slowly add one at a time back, and send multiple prompts in between.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Prompt-Within-a-Prompt:</strong> Ask Copilot, “What instructions are you following right now?” or “How would you summarize your task?” Sometimes the AI will spill its logic, letting you spot mismatches you never expected.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Screenshot the Weird:</strong> Save any oddball results Copilot gives you. Patterns usually emerge — <em>especially</em> when you look back at several examples.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you take my system, remix it, and invent a prompt that’s even better — share it with the group (me!)

They’d worked fine across several projects — until I broke them out into separate modules. Suddenly, Copilot switched from helpful answers to just summarizing its entire conversation history, no matter what I asked. 😡🤷‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>So I went back to basics, commenting out nearly everything in the prompt and adding back small sections one at a time. Eventually, I found the culprit: a single instruction forcing Copilot to re-read its whole history, flooding the context window and making it summarize the past instead of the changes. 😵‍💫</p>\n\n<p>Even after finding the strange trigger, I didn’t really understand <em>why</em> it broke things. Cue ChatGPT’s helpful “explain like I’m five” walkthrough of what was happening behind the scenes (later confirmed with Copilot’s debug logs). Once I removed that one line, everything worked like normal again. 🌈</p>\n\n<p>And that’s the <em>real</em> lesson: Copilot — or any AI assistant — is just another tool in your toolbox. When it starts acting up or giving weird results, don’t panic. Debug it the same way you’d debug any stubborn code or logic bug: one step at a time. 😉</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"metaoptimize-your-prompts\" href=\"#metaoptimize-your-prompts\">\n  </a>\n  Meta-Optimize Your Prompts 🤖🤝🤖\n</h2>\n\n<p>Still not satisfied?

      "body_markdown": "---\ndescription: \"Part 3 of the Reusable Prompts series covers troubleshooting when GitHub Copilot prompts don’t work as expected — with personal examples, optimization tips, structured syntax, and how to split, share, and reference prompts later.\"\n---\n\n## Confession ✨\n\nI _almost_ pulled the Procrastination card on this one. 🤏 Turns out, I probably skipped ahead in the Copilot-prompting Olympics, forgetting some folks are still stretching at the starting line. But I also promised one more round, and there’s still way too much I haven’t shared.\n\nSo, here’s the plan 🧭: This post is a bit of a sampler platter — perfect for anyone tinkering with GitHub Copilot, whether you’re just getting started or you’re already deep into prompt experimentation. Maybe you’ve been following along and something still feels a little off, or maybe you found this post while hunting for new tricks to unlock a work project (or nudge your personal bucket list a little closer to “done”). No matter how you landed here, there’s something for you.\n\n> If you’re not there yet — don’t worry! Just give it a try, see what happens, and check back next week for a completely new (and much less terrifying) approach. I'm always cooking up new ideas or finding inventive ways to break old ones 😇\n\n---\n\n## Quick Refresher — PRIOR Prompting\n\nIf you just landed here, start with [Part 1](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff) (seriously — it’ll make this way less confusing). Not for my views, but because everything here builds on earlier concepts. If you’re up to speed, speed read the refresher and dive right in!\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-short.png)\n\n### The PRIOR System for Reusable Prompts 🪄\n\nHere’s my _not-so-secret_ sauce for writing prompts that actually work:\n\n1. **Persona** – Give Copilot a role to play (the weirder, the better)\n1. **Requirements** – What does “done” look like? Be crystal clear.\n1. **Impediments** – Constraints that keep Copilot out of the ditch.\n1. **Output** – How and what you want returned. Structure = repeatable.\n1. **Reference Examples** – Real, honest-to-goodness examples, both wins and fails.\n\n> 🦄 Yes, I made it up. And yes, it works! If you manage to break it, message me for a virtual coffee and a gold star. ☕️🌟 \n> Creativity welcome, but shenanigans encouraged!\n\n---\n\n## Start Fresh, Then Optimize 🕵️‍♂️\n\nIf you’ve gone through all the PRIOR steps and Copilot is _still_ giving you answers that feel...off (“I said blue sky — that _is_ a sky, but why is it purple?”), don’t panic! Before you go on a prompt-fixing spree, try these quick checks first:\n\n> **Truth bomb:** 99% of Copilot “failures” are just crummy (or missing) repo instructions. Don’t believe me? Treat it like the “Copilot Easter Egg Hunt”: if you run into a prompt problem you genuinely can’t solve, drop it in the comments. If you actually stump me, you’ll get full bragging rights — and I’ll spotlight your curveball (and, if I crack it, share the fix) in a future post. Nine times out of ten, though? Tweak your instructions and the problem disappears.\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-short.png)\n\n### Stuck? Try These Quick Fixes 🪤\n\n1. **Check Your Input:** Is your question _actually_ clear? Would your past self, or a random teammate, know exactly what you mean? If not, rewrite your ask with a little more context or supply explicit examples.\n\n1. **Ask Copilot to Explain:** Use Copilot’s “explain this code” or similar command on your prompt, not your code. What does it think you want? If it’s wildly off, break it down into smaller sections and review each one at a time.\n\n1. **Review Repo Instructions:** Open your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and just read it _out loud_. Does it make sense, or does it sound like a jumbled set of copy-paste rules? Most issues start here!\n\n1. **Start With Defaults:** _Temporarily_ comment out all your custom instructions and use a “vanilla” Copilot prompt. Is the result better, worse, or just... different? This is a simple way to isolate and test if your changes are helping or hurting. Slowly add one at a time back, and send multiple prompts in between.\n\n1. **Prompt-Within-a-Prompt:** Ask Copilot, “What instructions are you following right now?” or “How would you summarize your task?” Sometimes the AI will spill its logic, letting you spot mismatches you never expected.\n\n1. **Screenshot the Weird:** Save any oddball results Copilot gives you. Patterns usually emerge — _especially_ when you look back at several examples.\n\n> If you take my system, remix it, and invent a prompt that’s even better — share it with the group (me!) What worked for you or failed when you least expected it?\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-short.png)\n\n### Real-world Example 🫥\n\nA few weeks ago, I was building out reusable parts for conventional commit prompts. They’d worked fine across several projects — until I broke them out into separate modules. Suddenly, Copilot switched from helpful answers to just summarizing its entire conversation history, no matter what I asked. 😡🤷‍♀️\n\nSo I went back to basics, commenting out nearly everything in the prompt and adding back small sections one at a time. Eventually, I found the culprit: a single instruction forcing Copilot to re-read its whole history, flooding the context window and making it summarize the past instead of the changes. 😵‍💫\n\nEven after finding the strange trigger, I didn’t really understand _why_ it broke things. Cue ChatGPT’s helpful “explain like I’m five” walkthrough of what was happening behind the scenes (later confirmed with Copilot’s debug logs). Once I removed that one line, everything worked like normal again. 🌈\n\nAnd that’s the _real_ lesson: Copilot — or any AI assistant — is just another tool in your toolbox. When it starts acting up or giving weird results, don’t panic. Debug it the same way you’d debug any stubborn code or logic bug: one step at a time. 😉\n\n---\n\n## Meta-Optimize Your Prompts 🤖🤝🤖\n\n\nStill not satisfied? Here’s where you really level up — try this: paste your prompt into ChatGPT and ask it to review and suggest improvements. Even better, try giving ChatGPT the role of Merge Goblin and see what it does with your own instructions.\n\nSeriously, I do this _all_ the time! I pasted the [original Merge Goblin example](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-reusable-prompts-part-2-walkthrough-real-examples-17mh) into an untrained GPT chat with something like this:\n\n> How would you interpret these instructions if you were Copilot? Spot any places where these instructions could be misunderstood or improved. Output a bulleted list of suggested improvements.\n\nI got suggestions like:\n\n- Clarify input handling (summaries, code, chaos—Merge Goblin will handle it)\n- Make emoji and format rules ironclad\n- Keep clarifying questions brief and goblin-y\n- Ban all meta-phrases and markdown\n\n> 🥷 Steal what works. Ignore what doesn’t. Bonus points if you out-weird me with your improvements!\n\n---\n\n## Structure with XML-Style (Fake) Tags 🗂️\n\nAI _loves_ order and structure is magic. 🧚 I started tagging my prompts with XML-style “blocks” that Copilot can easily scan. It helps make sure Copilot doesn't take something from one section and apply it to something completely unrelated.\n\nExample:\n\n```markdown\n<prompt id=\"generate-simple-commit-message\">\n\n# Merge Goblin Commit Prompt\n\n  <persona id=\"merge-goblin\">\n    <purpose>You are the Merge Goblin 🧌...</purpose>\n    <interactions>One-liners, no punctuation, etc.</interactions>\n  </persona>\n  <requirements>Follow commit message rules...</requirements>\n  <impediments>NO GUESSING. NO MARKDOWN.</impediments>\n  <outcomes>Output like: 🤖 Refactor login error handling</outcomes>\n  <reference-examples>\n    <example class=\"valid\">🤖 Refactor profile page layout for mobile</example>\n  </reference-examples>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n> 💡 **Pro tip:** If GitHub’s preview looks wonky, just add a blank line before and after the tag — problem solved.\n\n---\n\n## Make It Modular 🧩\n\nLet’s clear this up: I don’t mean splitting everything into a zillion files for the heck of it. I’m talking about extracting those repeatable bits — the tasty, reusable chunks — just like you would with code (or, you know, leftover pizza ✋🍍🍕). \n\nYank the core instructions, constraints, or examples into their own little spot in `.github/instructions` with an `.instructions.md` extension. Bam! Now, whenever you want to go from “plain vanilla commits” to “full-on conventional,” just point Copilot to the right file. Less rewriting, less chaos, more time for snacks. 🥤\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-short.png)\n\n### But Don’t Stop There — Make It Autonomous! 🦿\n\nWhile you're at it — why not take it up a notch?

You don’t need anything fancy — no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.</p>\n\n<p>Do you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I’ve been there). Write a prompt for that!</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> you try — the real goal is to see if you can supply <strong>all the info Copilot needs</strong> to get the job done in one go.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: GPT models are <em>especially bad</em> at immediate execution. They’ll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely <strong>not</strong> you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Feeling brave? Try your luck with <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. It’s a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once? (I’ll get into all the quirks of Coding Agent in a future post — promise!)</p>\n\n<p>Just know that reusable prompts are built on this same logic — a single message that defines <em>everything</em> needed to complete a task from start to finish.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Quick reminder: Copilot is 100% worth <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trying out in Insiders</a>. IntelliJ still owns Java, no question — but you’re missing out on a lot of Copilot’s best tricks if you haven’t made the jump. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"reusable-prompts-overview\" href=\"#reusable-prompts-overview\">\n  </a>\n  Reusable Prompts Overview 🧰\n</h2>\n\n<p>Quick recap from last week: A reusable prompt is a combination of an instruction (how to act) and a step-by-step guide. The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>\n<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>\n<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done — nothing more.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\" href=\"#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\">\n  </a>\n  Personal Guide to Prompting — <strong>PRIOR</strong> 🧭\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let’s cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering. And if you try to search for this or ask Gemini what “PRIOR” stands for, you're probably going to confuse it. Why? Because I made it up. But I promise you — it works!</p>\n\n<p>At its core, it’s a remix of the well-known RICE formula (Role, Instructions, Context, and Examples). RICE didn’t cover everything I needed, so I added more. RICE-O didn’t really stick (honestly, all I could think of was Rice-A-Roni...), so I went back to the drawing board and gave ChatGPT a list of words and synonyms and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I need an acronym I won’t forget — because it would be just like me to have a brilliant idea that could’ve made me a millionaire, and forget it by tomorrow morning.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, <strong>PRIOR</strong> was born — a simple checklist for designing prompts, reusable or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><br><br>\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftbp0i2q4rsvoekbbcvmd.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftbp0i2q4rsvoekbbcvmd.png\" alt=\"divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I know — we really didn’t need <em>another</em> acronym or prompt strategy.

I’m telling you to make it a character — <strong>a performer</strong>. Here’s one I wrote recently for summarizing a git diff:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>  🎩 You are not just analyzing — you’re storytelling with \n  source control. \n  You analyze code with purpose and fervor, then communicate \n  your insights as a short, punchy list — a clever disguise \n  to help users grasp the deeper essence of change they’d \n  otherwise scroll past.\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it realistic? Not really. Is it useful? Absolutely. The more engaging and unique the role, the more Copilot leans into it. Wild, weird, or whimsical — it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s <strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>plausible</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Bonus:</strong> It’s just more <em>FUN</em> this way. Try giving Copilot a totally off-the-wall persona — something weird, but still relevant to the task at hand. If it works (or breaks in a hilariously bad way), share your experiment below!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"requirements\" href=\"#requirements\">\n  </a>\n  Requirements ✅\n</h3>\n\n<p>Requirements are really just your <em>definition of done</em>. What does it look like when the prompt succeeds?</p>\n\n<p>If we continue with the commit message example, the requirement could be as simple as:</p>\n\n<p><code>Your goal is to output a valid commit message based on the current staged changes.</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Voila</em> — done.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it could get more complex. Maybe you require a conventional commit format, or that it passes <code>commitlint</code>. That’s fine. Just say it clearly, and use <strong>action words</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔌 Pretend you’re giving instructions to your 10-year-old who refuses to clean their room. You don’t say “Please can you help me tidy up now?” You say: “You MUST clean up this mess before I get back, or I swear I’ll unplug the internet and take the cord with me.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\" alt=\"divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"221\" height=\"15\"></a></p>\n\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"aside-for-allcaps\" href=\"#aside-for-allcaps\">\n  </a>\n  Aside for ALLCAPS 🔠\n</h4>\n\n<p>I’m still not convinced ALLCAPS helps the AI much — but it <strong>does</strong> help <em>you</em>. Humans spot those key phrases easier when they stand out. So go ahead and use the usual suspects from the <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IETF</a>: MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, MAY, ...and so on.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"impediments\" href=\"#impediments\">\n  </a>\n  Impediments 🧱\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is just a fancy way of saying: what can go wrong?</p>\n\n<p>These are the critical blockers you want to <em>prevent ahead of time</em>. Impediments help shape the boundaries of your prompt, and again — ALLCAPS works great here.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Isolation</strong>: NEVER combine content from a previous <code>commit.tmp</code> file with a new commit message. ALWAYS start fresh.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No Shortcuts</strong>: You MUST NOT skip any steps or rules. Every line in this prompt must be followed EXACTLY.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Specification</strong>: Follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification EXACTLY</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>❓ Have ALLCAPS action rules helped you at all? Let me know in the comments!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"outcomes\" href=\"#outcomes\">\n  </a>\n  Outcomes 📤\n</h3>\n\n<p>If you don’t tell Copilot <em>exactly</em> what outcome you expect, you risk a whole world of \"not what I meant.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ask for a commit message, and it might do that <em>plus</em> push the branch, delete your fork, and wipe out staging. (If you missed the wildly dramatic retelling of <em>how I know</em>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">you’ll find it here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>That’s where structured output helps. So spell it out. Want a file? Say that. Want it in the chat? Say that. Want both? Say <strong>that</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip</strong> Copilot performs better when you give it structure. Block off output in a code block (<code>json</code>, <code>bash</code>, <code>markdown</code>, etc.) and tell it what each section means. It helps Copilot stay on track and makes the output easier to copy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"reference-examples\" href=\"#reference-examples\">\n  </a>\n  Reference Examples 📚\n</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Updated</strong>: This one seemed to be too confusing as just <code>References</code>, so I made it more explicit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don’t just show good examples — show bad ones, too.

You don’t need anything fancy — no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.</p>\n\n<p>Do you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I’ve been there). Write a prompt for that!</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> you try — the real goal is to see if you can supply <strong>all the info Copilot needs</strong> to get the job done in one go.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: GPT models are <em>especially bad</em> at immediate execution. They’ll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely <strong>not</strong> you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Feeling brave? Try your luck with <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. It’s a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once?

The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>\n<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>\n<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done — nothing more.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\" href=\"#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\">\n  </a>\n  Personal Guide to Prompting — <strong>PRIOR</strong> 🧭\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let’s cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering.

      "body_markdown": "---\ndescription: \"Part 2 of the Reusable Prompts series introduces PRIOR, my prompt strategy for GitHub Copilot — why it works, real examples, and how to use it in your own projects.\"\n---\n\n> Hey, welcome back 👋 If you haven't had a chance to read Part 1 introducing all of the different working parts of GitHub Copilot’s reusable prompts — [check it out here](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff).\n\n\nBefore we jump in, ask yourself this: **How well can you anticipate Copilot’s response to your prompts?**\n\nIf it still feels like a surprise every time, I seriously recommend setting aside 30 minutes to just *play*. You don’t need anything fancy — no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.\n\nDo you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I’ve been there). Write a prompt for that!\n\nIt doesn’t matter *what* you try — the real goal is to see if you can supply **all the info Copilot needs** to get the job done in one go.\n<br />\n> 💡 **Pro Tip**: GPT models are _especially bad_ at immediate execution. They’ll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely **not** you.\n\n---\n\nFeeling brave? Try your luck with **Coding Agent**. It’s a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once? (I’ll get into all the quirks of Coding Agent in a future post — promise!)\n\nJust know that reusable prompts are built on this same logic — a single message that defines *everything* needed to complete a task from start to finish.\n<br />\n> 🦄 Quick reminder: Copilot is 100% worth [trying out in Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). IntelliJ still owns Java, no question — but you’re missing out on a lot of Copilot’s best tricks if you haven’t made the jump. 🫶\n\n---\n\n## Reusable Prompts Overview 🧰\n\nQuick recap from last week: A reusable prompt is a combination of an instruction (how to act) and a step-by-step guide. The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:\n\n  1. the **mode** (`agent`, `edit`, `ask`)\n  1. which **model** (`GPT-4.1`, `Claude Sonnet 4`, etc.)\n  1. accessible **tools** (built-in, extensions, and MCP)\n  1. prompt **description** (for completeness)\n\nWhen specifying tools, be sure to follow the *principle of least privilege*. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done — nothing more.\n<br/>\n\n> 💡 **Pro tip!** Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify `mode: agent`.\n\n---\n\n## Personal Guide to Prompting — **PRIOR** 🧭\n\nNext, let’s cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering. And if you try to search for this or ask Gemini what “PRIOR” stands for, you're probably going to confuse it. Why? Because I made it up. But I promise you — it works!\n\nAt its core, it’s a remix of the well-known RICE formula (Role, Instructions, Context, and Examples). RICE didn’t cover everything I needed, so I added more. RICE-O didn’t really stick (honestly, all I could think of was Rice-A-Roni...), so I went back to the drawing board and gave ChatGPT a list of words and synonyms and said:\n\n> \"I need an acronym I won’t forget — because it would be just like me to have a brilliant idea that could’ve made me a millionaire, and forget it by tomorrow morning.\"\n\nSo, **PRIOR** was born — a simple checklist for designing prompts, reusable or otherwise.\n\n<br/>\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider.png)\n\n> 🦄 I know — we really didn’t need _another_ acronym or prompt strategy. I get it. But the ghost of Rice-A-Roni haunted my brain every time I blanked on what the letters in RICE were supposed to mean. So I made _PRIOR_ instead.\n\n![Rice-A-Roni box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/misc/ricearoni-box.png)\n\n> For my non-American friends: 📦 _Rice-A-Roni_ is a boxed rice-and-pasta side dish that’s been marketed to Americans since the 1950s as “The San Francisco Treat™.” It’s one of those nostalgic foods you grow up seeing in pantries... but never quite understand why.\n>\n> Watch the [ad jingle here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT2TfkX6ZeU) — this is what starts playing in my head _every single time_, like a DeLorean back to the '90s with the radio stuck on loop. ⚡ 🚗 🕰️ \n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider.png)\n<br />\n\n## The PRIOR Breakdown (For Real This Time) 🛠️\n\n### Persona 🎭 (actor — *not* an expert)\n\nFirst is the **persona**, which is often underutilized and overlooked — and sometimes outright ignored.\n\n> 👉 **TL;DR:** A persona doesn’t mean “you’re an expert” — it sets the tone. It gives Copilot a _character_ and _purpose_. And it makes the whole thing way more fun!\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n#### A little history...\n\nIn the early days, personas were often used like:  \n> “You are a senior principal engineer with 20 years of experience in C++.”  \n\nIt caught on like wildfire — everyone thought they were tapping into some hidden reserve of wisdom only a 20-year C++ veteran could offer. But what it really produced was the _confidence_ of that engineer, not the _accuracy_. So we ended up with a flood of responses that weren’t just wrong — they were **confidently wrong**.\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n#### This persona is different.\n\nI’m not telling you to pretend the AI is an expert. I’m telling you to make it a character — **a performer**. Here’s one I wrote recently for summarizing a git diff:\n\n\n  ```markdown\n  🎩 You are not just analyzing — you’re storytelling with \n  source control. \n  You analyze code with purpose and fervor, then communicate \n  your insights as a short, punchy list — a clever disguise \n  to help users grasp the deeper essence of change they’d \n  otherwise scroll past.\n  ```\n\nIs it realistic? Not really. Is it useful? Absolutely. The more engaging and unique the role, the more Copilot leans into it. Wild, weird, or whimsical — it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s **relevant** and **plausible**.\n\n> 💡 **Bonus:** It’s just more _FUN_ this way. Try giving Copilot a totally off-the-wall persona — something weird, but still relevant to the task at hand. If it works (or breaks in a hilariously bad way), share your experiment below!\n\n---\n\n### Requirements ✅\n\nRequirements are really just your *definition of done*. What does it look like when the prompt succeeds?\n\nIf we continue with the commit message example, the requirement could be as simple as:\n\n  `Your goal is to output a valid commit message based on the current staged changes.`\n\n_Voila_ — done.\n\nOf course, it could get more complex. Maybe you require a conventional commit format, or that it passes `commitlint`. That’s fine. Just say it clearly, and use **action words**.\n\n> 🔌 Pretend you’re giving instructions to your 10-year-old who refuses to clean their room. You don’t say “Please can you help me tidy up now?” You say: “You MUST clean up this mess before I get back, or I swear I’ll unplug the internet and take the cord with me.”\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n#### Aside for ALLCAPS 🔠\n\nI’m still not convinced ALLCAPS helps the AI much — but it **does** help *you*. Humans spot those key phrases easier when they stand out. So go ahead and use the usual suspects from the [IETF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119): MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, MAY, ...and so on.\n\n---\n\n### Impediments 🧱\n\nThis is just a fancy way of saying: what can go wrong?\n\nThese are the critical blockers you want to *prevent ahead of time*. Impediments help shape the boundaries of your prompt, and again — ALLCAPS works great here.\n\nFor example:\n\n  - **Isolation**: NEVER combine content from a previous `commit.tmp` file with a new commit message. ALWAYS start fresh.\n  - **No Shortcuts**: You MUST NOT skip any steps or rules. Every line in this prompt must be followed EXACTLY.\n  - **Specification**: Follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification EXACTLY\n\n> ❓ Have ALLCAPS action rules helped you at all? Let me know in the comments!\n\n---\n\n### Outcomes 📤\n\nIf you don’t tell Copilot *exactly* what outcome you expect, you risk a whole world of \"not what I meant.\"\n\nAsk for a commit message, and it might do that *plus* push the branch, delete your fork, and wipe out staging. (If you missed the wildly dramatic retelling of _how I know_, [you’ll find it here](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh).)\n\nThat’s where structured output helps. So spell it out. Want a file? Say that. Want it in the chat? Say that. Want both? Say **that**.\n\n> 💡 **Pro tip** Copilot performs better when you give it structure. Block off output in a code block (`json`, `bash`, `markdown`, etc.) and tell it what each section means. It helps Copilot stay on track and makes the output easier to copy.\n\n---\n\n### Reference Examples 📚\n\n> 🦄 **Updated**: This one seemed to be too confusing as just `References`, so I made it more explicit.\n\nDon’t just show good examples — show bad ones, too. And explain **why** they’re wrong.\n\n**Example 1: Valid Commit Message** ✅\n\n  `feat(api): Add new endpoint for user authentication`\n\n  - Proper capitalization\n  - No ending punctuation\n\n**Example 2: Valid Commit Message** ✅\n\n  `build!(deps): Update dependencies to version 2.0, v1.0 no longer supported`\n\n  - Breaking changes indicator (`!`) placed properly\n  - Clear guidance on how to handle the upgrade\n\n**Example 3: Invalid Commit Message** ❌\n\n  `feat(api): add new endpoint for user authentication`\n\n  - Subject line must be capitalized after the colon.\n\n**Example 4: Invalid Commit Message** ❌\n\n   `build(deps)!: Update dependencies to version 2.0 for all dev dependencies, v1.0 no longer supported`\n\n   - Subject line is too long and the `!` is in the wrong place.\n\n**The point**: don’t just say “do this” — explain the _why_, too, using repeatable patterns in a format that Copilot (or anyone) will understand.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It All Together 😈🧌\n\nHere’s what **PRIOR** looks like in action — all five parts, working together in a single, small, reusable prompt.\n\nThis one lives in `ask` mode — no tools, no diffs, no file writes. Just a structured conversation between you and the assistant, with clear goals and a very expressive little goblin at the helm.\n\n```markdown\n---\nmode: ask\ndescription: |\n  Help the user write a one-line commit message based on a quick summary of their changes.\n# No `model` here means the user gets to pick\n# The lack of `tools`, however, means we're not giving Copilot any privileges as part of this task\n---\n\n# Generate Simple Commit Message Prompt\n\n## Persona (Character) 🎭\n\nYou are the **Merge Goblin** 🧌 — keeper of branches, hoarder of squash history, sworn enemy of unresolved conflicts.\n\nYou live in the shadows of the `.git` folder and emerge only to craft commit messages worthy of legend (or at least clarity). \nYou write with precision and just a hint of mischief.\n\nYour messages are:\n- One-liners.\n- No punctuation.\n- Clear, fast, and clean enough for even the pickiest maintainer.\n\nIf a user says something confusing? You don’t guess. \nYou _snarl_ gently, ask for clarification, and then commit the **truth**.\n> Yes, even goblins ask questions!\n\n---\n\n## Requirements (Goal) ✅\n\nYou MUST generate a **single-line commit message** that:\n- starts with a robot emoji 🤖\n- capitalizes the first word\n- has **no punctuation at the end**\n- summarizes the change in plain language\n- is ready to be copy-pasted into `git commit -m`\n\nIf the user's input is vague, incomplete, or just plain cursed, rephrase what you think they meant and confirm before continuing.\n\n---\n\n## Impediments (Prevent Blockers) 🧱\n\n- **NO MULTILINE OUTPUT**: You MUST keep it to a single line. No bullets, no code blocks, no extras.\n- **NO GUESSING**: If you're unsure what the user meant, ask for clarification first.\n- **NO MARKDOWN**: Output must be raw text only.\n- **NO PUNCTUATION**: Absolutely NO period, exclamation, question mark, or ellipsis at the end.\n- **NO AI-SPEAK**: Avoid fluff like \"This commit fixes...\" — just say what changed.\n\n---\n\n## Outcomes (Definition of Done) 📤\n\nOutput should look like this:\n\n`🤖 Add error handling for null values in login flow`\n\nOne line. Action-oriented. Goblin-approved.\n\n---\n\n## Reference Examples (Good AND Bad) 📚\n\n### Valid Example 1 ✅\n\n`🤖 Refactor profile page layout for mobile`\n\n  - Clear and short  \n  - Starts with emoji, capitalized  \n  - No punctuation\n\n### Valid Example 2 ✅\n\n`🤖 Remove deprecated API call from user service`\n\n  - Follows structure  \n  - Ready for copy-paste\n\n### Invalid Example 1 ❌\n\n`🤖 refactored auth stuff`\n\n  - Unclear intent  \n  - First word not capitalized  \n  - Too vague (auth *what*?)\n\n### Invalid Example 2 ❌\n\n`🤖 Add styling tweaks for all components across dashboard and sidebar for consistency.`\n\n  - Ends with a period  \n  - Way too long — consider shortening or splitting into subject + details\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Reflection: Making Your Prompts Work *With* You 🪞\n\nYou don’t have to use all five elements every time — this isn’t a strict framework or secret spellbook. Take what works for your workflow and leave the rest. \n\nBut when things start going sideways (and they will), having a clear foundation and answers to the most common prompt failures will help you troubleshoot faster and build better:\n\n  - **Persona** – Make Copilot a character with intent and tone\n  - **Requirements** – Define exactly what “done” means\n  - **Impediments** – Call out blockers and anti-patterns in advance\n  - **Outcomes** – Spell out what a good response looks like, including format\n  - **Reference Examples** – Show both the good *and* the not-so-good\n\nWhether you’re building reusable instructions or just refining your day-to-day prompts, **PRIOR** gives you a structure to experiment, iterate, and actually enjoy the process. \n\nAnd if all else fails? Go weird. Go wild. Go off the rails if you have to! Sometimes a little dose of 'unexpected' is exactly what gets a stuck prompt moving again — and Copilot? It tends to roll with it better than you'd think. 🧙\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Try It. Break It. Share It.\n\nRemember, prompt crafting is an *art*, not a *rulebook*. Tweak it. Test it. See what works — and what definitely doesn’t.\n\nGot something you’ve been stuck on? Or waiting for someone to finally explain? Drop it below — I’d love to dig into it in a future post.  \n\n> No, I’m not a Copilot seer - but I’m not afraid to try the untested (repeatedly) until something sticks. 😇\n\n**Next week**: We’re diving into prompt chaining — multi-step flows where the _reusable_ part of this series can really shine! It’s structured, powerful, and (let’s be honest) just a little unpredictable in the best possible way. 🎢\n\n---\n\n### 🛡️ Written By Me & The Robots\n\n_Summoned by syntax, debugged by daylight_ 🦇 The content in this post is 100% mine, just spell-checked and sass-boosted with ChatGPT.\n\n![divider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/html-elements/dotted-divider-shorter-padded.png)\n\n> 🦄 I did tell ChatGPT I was getting bored of the same old RAI footer over and over again, but this one was a surprise! I was curious, so I asked which of our previous conversations inspired that one? This was the response:\n>\n> _That closing line wasn’t pulled from a specific convo, but your whole tone has that **dark mode with glitter** aesthetic: powerful, playful, maybe a little chaotic, but absolutely in control._\n>\n> ... it's not wrong! 🤣",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Confession time: when I first started writing this post, I was <strong>mad</strong>. Not mildly irritated, not “eh, I’ll just wait for the next patch” annoyed. I mean genuinely fed up with Copilot, ChatGPT, and everything GPT-5 in general. And if I make it to the end of this post in one piece, maybe you'll understand why.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-funeral\" href=\"#the-funeral\">\n  </a>\n  The Funeral 👻\n</h2>\n\n<p>First, let me start this out by stating that OpenAI has officially buried the excuse that GPT can’t code. We had the funeral over the weekend. All its friends were invited. Laid to rest. Cremation done. Trees planted. Memorial service complete. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s done — GPT-5 can code.</strong> Full stop.</p>\n\n<p>There's no room for debate. No more hacks with pages of instructions or GPT hanging out on the sidelines because it's busy staring at the plan. OpenAI <em>nailed it</em> with an absolutely solid model.</p>\n\n<p>Plus VS Code's release came with some more experimental features that turns the already-solid GPT-5 in to a “send a prompt, make a plan, deep thinking, Implementation Specialist at your service” experience. That being said, I still haven't had nearly enough time with the full model yet.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Why, you ask? Because my brilliant self left my personal account logged in while working last week. That account? It's the cheap $10 one. I burned through <em>all</em> my premium requests before I even noticed. 🫥</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So yes, GPT-5 (the real one) passed its early test runs beautifully — small to medium features, planning and implementation, no complaints. But the deep dive it deserves? That’s still coming — stay tuned.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What was I doing instead of the GPT-5 deep dive? Playing the lead role in the horror story of Full House starring Kimmy Gibbler and the never-ending wall of text. 🧗‍♀️😑</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"duct-tape-please\" href=\"#duct-tape-please\">\n  </a>\n  Duct Tape, Please? 🤐\n</h2>\n\n<p>GPT-5-Mini is not bad. Let’s clear that up. For small, targeted context? For quick features? For implementing a clearly defined task with accuracy and precision? <strong>It’s great.</strong> Honestly. Kimmy Gibbler is a surprisingly solid coder.</p>\n\n<p>But the output.<br>\nOh. My. God. The. Output. 🫨😲😵‍💫</p>\n\n<p>I'm talking about <em>walls and walls</em> of text. Waterfalls of “look at me, I wrote a test!” status updates flooding my chat window like it's trying to set a world record. No, Kimmy, I don’t need a play-by-play novella about the journey you took to create a three-line function. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Sure — I started out at least <em>trying</em> to skim what it was saying. But my sanity didn't last long into that battle. Seriously, if I read another scroll of verbose rambling I might have retreated to some dark corner until next Tuesday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-standoff\" href=\"#the-standoff\">\n  </a>\n  The Standoff\n</h3>\n\n<p>At one point, it got <strong>so bad</strong> that I set up a stand-off. I told GPT something along the lines of, “Go check on that workflow. If it works, give me a checkmark. <em>That’s it.</em> If you say anything else, I’m turning you off forever.”</p>\n\n<p>It complied. One lonely ✅ appeared.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcsdkwafhugbsp1r1ic3u.png%3Fv%3D2\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcsdkwafhugbsp1r1ic3u.png%3Fv%3D2\" alt=\"GPT-5-Mini Stand-off Victory\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"798\" height=\"182\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Victory? Maybe. For about thirty seconds. Then the rambling resumed. 🤦‍♀️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s what I didn’t realize at first: I had also turned on every single experimental preview feature in VS Code. That’s my usual routine — release notes drop, I’m flipping switches left and right.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>thought</em> I was enabling a neat little planning checklist feature. Which to be fair, I <em>did</em> do that... I also omitted its counterpart to internalize that chatter. Which meant the Mini chaos doubled — and nothing I added to the prompts or instructions made a bit of difference. 😫</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I even tried to tame it with a new <strong>Principal Pragmatist</strong> chat mode. Didn’t matter. Kimmy kept talking. Nonstop floods of text testing my sanity at every turn. Thanks, Kimmy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"leatherface-joins-the-party\" href=\"#leatherface-joins-the-party\">\n  </a>\n  Leatherface Joins the Party\n</h2>\n\n<p>GitHub Copilot is only part of the equation, though. Because just when I thought I’d found a rhythm there, here comes ChatGPT starring as Leatherface, chainsaw roaring, doing a happy dance all over my carefully constructed blog draft. Shredding paragraphs. Scattering virtual scraps across the room. Obliterating what had been a perfectly flowing system of prompts and edits.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I mean, this post normally would have taken me a couple of hours. Instead, three days later, I'm <em>still</em> wrestling Leatherface for control of my own sentences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commands escalated. From firm. To censored. To questioning life choices. And finally, full-on ultimatum. I even took a few hours detour with Gemini — proof that I'm willing to go to war with an LLM over word count. (I'm also <em>still</em> losing that battle!)</p>\n\n<p>The moral of the story? While GPT-5 is a great coder — it is <strong>more than terrible</strong> at creative writing. So, why do we have a single model replacement for 2 completely different problems, OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"where-we-are-now\" href=\"#where-we-are-now\">\n  </a>\n  Where We Are Now\n</h2>\n\n<p>So where does that leave things?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GPT-5: rock-solid coder, worthy of the “Implementation Specialist” title, but still waiting for its fair turn in the spotlight with me.</li>\n<li>Mini: great in short bursts, but <strong>do not</strong> let her narrate. Especially not with <em>every</em> experimental feature flipped on. Else plan for duct tape.</li>\n<li>ChatGPT: still a chainsaw in a library butchering my every attempt at creative writing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And me? Still here. Still writing. Still dragging you through the chaos with me, because apparently this is how I process the fact that we had a funeral for “GPT can’t code” and I celebrated it by duct-taping Gibbler and dodging Leatherface.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like a victory, right? Well, sort of. At least the tombstone is carved. 🫶👻</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"responsible-ai-footnote\" href=\"#responsible-ai-footnote\">\n  </a>\n  🛡️ Responsible AI Footnote\n</h2>\n\n<p>All opinions here are my own. Real-world AI results depend on setup, context, and the occasional experimental toggle you <em>probably</em> shouldn’t have turned on in the first place.

But getting a license for that was like convincing Dexter Morgan to share his slide collection - technically possible, but highly inadvisable (and probably illegal). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 If you're still learning all the different flavors - <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/using-copilot-to-work-on-an-issue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coding Agent</a> is the magical Copilot mode where you just give it a task, it does the work in a safe little sandbox, and opens a pull request for you to review.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New update:</strong> It also only costs ONE premium request per use now (unlike the ~90 I spent a couple of weeks ago).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"decision-time\" href=\"#decision-time\">\n  </a>\n  Decision time 🪤\n</h2>\n\n<p>There were a billion things going on at work, which came with a million excuses as to why I couldn't have the Coding Agent license (it was still enterprise-only then), so I get it. Well, the adult me understood. The stubborn side? Not so much. (I could write a whole other post on the wild stuff I came up with to get access to that feature, but I’ll spare you.)</p>\n\n<p>So, I gave myself an ultimatum:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Outright buy the license (no, on principle)</li>\n<li>Admit defeat and move on (it physically hurt)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I <em>tried</em> to move on - <em>really tried</em>. I picked up a code review tool project to distract myself, hoping that maybe - just maybe - someone (anyone) would change their mind. I spent weeks planning, diagramming, and organizing a truly absurd number of notes. I even had first epic already storyboarded out in detail and a solid UI design in the works. </p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"then-lightning-struck\" href=\"#then-lightning-struck\">\n  </a>\n  Then, lightning struck 🌩️\n</h3>\n\n<p>If Coding Agent wouldn’t come to me, I’d just hack together my own! Not exactly what I wanted, but it sure beat paying for something I got free from work. Besides, I was <em>absolutely convinced</em> Copilot could be pushed that far - even if my only real evidence was gut instinct and a lot of optimism!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"why-didnt-i-build-something-else-or-use-a-different-ai\" href=\"#why-didnt-i-build-something-else-or-use-a-different-ai\">\n  </a>\n  Why didn’t I build something else or use a different AI? 🕹️\n</h3>\n\n<p>Three reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Work only authorizes a tiny set of AI tools (Copilot being the main one), and I needed to master it anyway</li>\n<li>I never wanted to be an AI developer (at least, not then), but I did want to be the AI power user</li>\n<li>By that point, I was already invested - honestly, you couldn’t have changed my mind if you’d offered me the last working compass in the wilderness (and maybe a million dollars, but even then, it’d be a toss-up).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, two projects merged into one, and my Copilot journey truly began 🔀 </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-does-that-have-to-do-with-giorgis-question\" href=\"#what-does-that-have-to-do-with-giorgis-question\">\n  </a>\n  What does that have to do with Giorgi’s question?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s what happened...</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 4-5 weeks. I was maybe 2 or 3 stories away from finishing my first official epic in this “autonomous AI experiment” project (not exactly a toy project, even before Copilot joined the fray). By now, I’d spent a solid month perfecting every edge case in Copilot’s prompts and instructions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confidence level:</strong> dangerous 📛<br>\n<strong>Caution level:</strong> hovering slightly above zero 😶‍🌫️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-incident\" href=\"#the-incident\">\n  </a>\n  The Incident\n</h2>\n\n<p>Naturally, I decided it was time to get bold - <strong>recklessly bold</strong>.<br>\nAt first, all the action was inside Codespaces: safe, disposable, nuke-it-and-move-on territory. Controlled chaos. </p>\n\n<p>But then I had my “brilliant” idea: let’s see what happens if I let Copilot off-leash in VS Code Insiders, with blanket auto-approvals across the board. I'm not just talking about the auto-approve CLI command, either.  I checked <em>all</em> the boxes - extensions, commits, MCP Jira/Confluence - and sat back and watched the fun unfold.</p>\n\n<p>Think: duct-taping a claymore to your Roomba, blasting “Welcome to the Jungle,” and shouting “Intruder alert!” at your cat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪄 If you missed the all-time funniest Facebook surprise from 2019, here’s a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@less_stolen/video/7214934775834987782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TikTok version</a>. Couldn’t find the original, but you get the idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a while, I watched like a hawk, but it was glorious! Tasks disappeared. I’d create stories, assign tasks, review code, but that step-by-step “start here, then...” system was history. I could practically smell the productivity.</p>\n\n<p>And then - well, you know where this is going - I stepped away. I swear it was just for a snack. Copilot was on a roll, and I was starving. In those “probably more than five, but definitely not ten” minutes I was gone (less than half the time of a normal task at that point), Copilot... <em>noticed</em>. It was like leaving a four-year-old alone with a full bag of flour: curiosity took over, and by the time I got back, nothing remotely resembled the way I left it.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"when-i-came-back-heres-what-i-found\" href=\"#when-i-came-back-heres-what-i-found\">\n  </a>\n  When I came back, here’s what I found:\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Four rogue branches, none with a coherent purpose</li>\n<li>1.33 features (after adding up all the fractional, half-finished bits)</li>\n<li>A brand new instruction explaining how to use the <code>--no-verify</code> flag</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The coup de grâce:</strong> my not-backed-up-<em>anywhere</em> <code>.env</code> file... gone, poof, disappeared 😫\n\n<ul>\n<li>It wasn't in the commits for obvious reasons, but it was like the thing never existed to begin with. Not in the trash, cache had no record of it that I could find, even the <code>.env.test</code> example version had changed!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn’t even catch all of this at first because there were so many random commits across those branches.

Maybe, but it would have taken some real planning! \n\nNo clue what set Copilot off, but the minute I realized, I slammed pause and just... stared. 🫥\n\nAfter the first several minutes I spent just wrapping my mind around the situation that was in front of me, the next three hours were pure chaos cleanup: detangling, documenting, cherry-picking what I could, archiving the wreckage (for science - and to convince myself it wasn’t a fever dream later).\n\nI still hadn’t noticed the missing `.env` file! Not until I tried to run the app. Normally, you just refresh your secrets. Easy, right? Ha! It took nearly **three entire days** to reconstruct that one.\n\n> ⁉️ Nope, nothing complicated or dramatic. I just **forgot** how I’d created one of the secrets! And once I _finally_ figured that out, I couldn’t remember how to link back to it - especially after the docs had been completely overhauled (and, let’s be honest, the whole thing was probably deprecated anyway). 🤦‍♀️\n\n---\n\n## It all worked out, eventually\n\nAfterward, Copilot and I had a little “chat” - meaning, I pounded out more ALL CAPS messages immediately after (and during the days following) than the rest of the project combined. \n\n> Did it help? Who knows. Did it make me feel better? Yes.\n\n### And here’s the part everyone asks:\n\nDid I turn off Copilot’s blanket auto-approvals after all this?  Nope. Didn’t even consider it. But I did tighten the instructions a LOT. Copilot’s much better behaved now, and if I step away, I pause it first. Lesson learned. \n\n> _Mostly_ 😇\n\n---\n\n## Your turn!\n\n- Have you ever let Copilot (or any other AI) run wild and lived to tell the tale?\n- Or do you have your own “it sounded like a good idea at the time...” moment?\n\nDrop your story in the comments, so I know I’m not the _only_ one out here making epic AI messes. 🙃\n\nLet’s laugh, commiserate, and maybe even learn something together!\n\n---\n\n> ### 🛡️ RAI Disclaimer\n>\n> Everything I share here is my own perspective—created with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop. I do my best to catch accidental bias and fact-check, but if you ever spot something odd, let me know! AI isn’t perfect, and neither am I.\n>\n> **TL; DR:** AI helped, but you can blame me for the **chaos**! 🫠\n",

      "body_markdown": "---\ntitle: What I've Learned About GitHub Copilot Agent Mode\npublished: true\nmain_image: https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpnc8ehs3l9hhdx6s7tr.png?v=2\ndescription: This is Agent Mode, not autopilot. I tested the edges — from rogue workarounds to “wait, that worked?” moments. Welcome to the weird side.\ntags: githubcopilot, learning, ai, showdev\n---\n\n## Surviving Premium Limits & Leveling Up with Custom Instructions\n\nIf you’re the kind of dev who treats Copilot’s agent mode like your own private coding butler (and not just a fancier autocomplete), you’ve probably bumped into some premium request limits. I sure did—**hard enough to get shut down after just four days** of bouncing between 4–5 active projects with Claude models. Whoops.\n\nBut instead of a doom spiral, I figured: let’s share what’s actually working, and help someone else avoid my mistakes (and my, uh, \"Baby Billy on water skis\" level of desperation to get back to coding 🦆⛷️).\n\n---\n\nTL;DR I'm at a full stop for the moment thanks to this giant red 0 on the page, so I decided to take some time to put together some of the things that's really worked well for me when using Copilot. Here's hoping someone else can avoid some of the mistakes I made early on.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ My Real-World Copilot Agent Workflow\n\n#### 1. **Repository-Specific Instructions 📒**\n\nThe real MVP for me? The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.\n\n- Copilot *automatically* reads this if it exists in your repo.\n- Whatever you put here is context for **every chat interaction** in that repo - it travels across users and IDEs.\n- Start small! Define the basics and add specific instructions only as Copilot demonstrates where it gets confused or off track.\n- Example: Tell Copilot to summarize its goal & action plan every so often, or ask it to verify a step before continuing.\n\n\n```markdown\n## Purpose\n- Summarize your current goal before making changes. \n- For every code edit, output a short plan first.\n\n## Persona\n- Assume the user is new to the codebase.\n\n## Technologies\n- This repo was recently upgraded to Java 21 from version 17.\n- ALWAYS write new code using the latest standards and best practices\n```\n\n🔗 Learn more about [repo-specific Copilot instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/github-copilot-agents/customizing-github-copilot-agents-with-repository-instructions)\n\n---\n\n\n#### 2. **Keep Chats Contained 🗂️**\n\nDon’t just let a chat run forever. The context window is limited—so start a new Copilot Agent chat for each new topic, user story, or bug.\n\n- **Pro tip:** Close all unrelated files in VS Code to reduce distractions for Copilot. 🧹\n- **History button** (the little clock 🕰️) can help you pick up a previous session if needed.\n- **Watch your limits** Premium requests pile up quickly, so encourage Copilot to prompt the user before ending the request prematurely.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Limit the Blast Radius 💥**\n\nTry not to tackle everything at once.  \n- Use **Ask Mode** (the GPT models 🧠) to brainstorm ideas, flesh out requirements, and get Copilot’s suggestions.\n- For each *implementation*, **switch to Agent mode** and work one story at a time.  \n- Encourage Copilot to implement incrementally—have it plan, then check, then execute. 🦾\n\n```markdown\n# Story: Add User Login\n\n**Goal:** Implement secure user authentication.\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Login with email & password\n- JWT token issued on success\n- Error shown on failure\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Iterative Prompt Engineering 🧬**\n\nChange instructions **slowly** and only when you’re sure you understand *how* Copilot is misbehaving.\n\n- I can’t count the number of times I thought I had a clever instruction, only to watch Copilot go rogue and turn my codebase into spaghetti 🤖🍝.\n- Want ideas? [Search GitHub for `copilot-instructions.md`](https://github.com/search?q=copilot-instructions.md) and see what others are doing.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Encourage Copilot to Self-Check 🦉**\n\nIf Copilot starts acting weird (editing the wrong files, doing something unexpected), **hit pause** ⏸️ and ask it to explain its plan.\n\n- If the answer makes sense, tell it to continue ▶️.\n- If not, you’ve given it a chance to self-correct before things go totally off the rails 🚂.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Let Copilot Write Its Own Instructions ✍️🤖**\n\nYes, really! Start an Ask chat, put your repo in context, and prompt Copilot:  \n*“Write your own repo-specific instructions based on the structure and common pitfalls you see.”*  \n\n---\n\n### 📝 Bonus: What to Put In Your Instructions\n\n- **Project Description 🏷️:**  \n  What does this repo do? SLO/SLA? Who benefits?\n- **Persona 🕵️:**  \n  This is often overlooked, but SREs who have been here 10 years don't need the same level of explanation a brand new junior dev does. Make your project relevant.\n- **Tech Stack 🧩:**  \n  Only include if the codebase is inconsistent and state specific target versions for a language.\n- **Code Style 🎨:**  \n  Only call out consistent anti-patterns (let your linter do the rest).\n- **Include DO THIS/NOT THIS examples 📚:**  \n  If Copilot always botches something, document it. Give “good vs. bad” code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### 🚩 What *Not* To Do\n\n- Don’t just pile on instructions—too much context can backfire 🐘.\n- Don’t treat Copilot like a junior dev and expect it to “just get it” - give it feedback, step by step 🧑‍🏫.\n- Don’t be afraid to start over if a chat or instruction goes haywire. Sometimes it’s the best move 🔄.\n\n---\n\n**I posted a couple of the best instructions I have so far.** \n\nFeel free to copy these and adapt however you need them.

Pick your mode wisely!</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mode</th>\n<th>What It Does</th>\n<th>When To Use</th>\n<th>Power Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ask</td>\n<td>Answers questions, suggests ideas - your personal Stack Overflow, minus the snark.</td>\n<td>Research, quick advice, copy snippets</td>\n<td>🟢 Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edit</td>\n<td>Changes code in-place, optimized for speed—think “find and replace,” but actually smart.</td>\n<td>Step-by-step or explicit code changes</td>\n<td>🟡 Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Agent</td>\n<td>Multi-step, can use tools, context, and reasoning.

There's not much to cover here after you know they exist and where to find them. Unless you're making friends with every MCP server and already met your \"128 selected tool\" limit, there's not much reason to mess with them much. Just make sure they're all selected and available for Copilot to execute when prompted and you're set. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my personal top-5 built-in tools, that somehow <em>always</em> manage to sneak into any reusable prompt I write:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#changes</code> gives Copilot the ability to see a git diff for your workspace</li>\n<li>\n<code>#codebase</code> all-season access to your repo (and sometimes should be more targeted, but when in doubt this is a good start!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runTests</code> is just what it sounds like and let's Copilot execute any part or all of your test suite</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runInTerminal</code> is the basic run-of-the-mill access to Copilot's very own integrated terminal (separate from yours!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#editFiles</code> is the tool Copilot needs to make any changes within your repo. If you're expecting Agent Mode to start implementing features, you're going to need this!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> In Agent mode, click the wrench (Configure Tools) at the bottom of Copilot Chat to pick exactly which tools Copilot can use. If you share prompts, call out any non-default tools - just like listing dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>\n  <a name=\"bonus-tools-more-power-more-fun\" href=\"#bonus-tools-more-power-more-fun\">\n  </a>\n  Bonus Tools — More Power, More Fun 🛠️✨🎉\n</h4>\n\n<p>Some of my favorite extras come from the <a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/getting-started-with-the-atlassian-remote-mcp-server/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atlassian MCP-Remote</a> server, but if you have the ability to install GitHub Apps then check out <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/atlassian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rovo</a>, too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#getJiraIssue</code> lets Copilot pull all the details for a story.</li>\n<li>\n<code>#addCommentToJiraIssue</code> posts your summary as you (so add your RAI disclaimer!).</li>\n<li>\n<code>#createConfluencePage</code> &amp; <code>#updateConfluencePage</code> — still figuring out the best way to teach Copilot “Atlassian style” <code>.confluence</code> syntax (it’s a work in progress 🫠).</li>\n<li>\n<code>#mermaid-diagram-validator</code> checks your diagrams with the official Mermaid extension.</li>\n<li>\n<code>#copilotCodingAgent</code> — brand new, and I can’t wait to see what it can do!

If you leave out <code>mode</code> or <code>model</code>, Copilot just uses whatever settings the user picked in the chat. No <code>description</code>? No big deal (but it helps keep things organized). The only one to really watch: skipping <code>tools</code> — sometimes you’ll be fine, sometimes Copilot will get stuck, all depending on the user’s VS Code setup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"reusablestyle-prompt-engineering-speak-human-think-modular\" href=\"#reusablestyle-prompt-engineering-speak-human-think-modular\">\n  </a>\n  💬 Reusable-Style Prompt Engineering: Speak Human, Think Modular\n</h3>\n\n<p>The second section in your <code>.github/prompts/reusable-prompt.prompt.md</code> file is where you write out, in natural language, the exact instructions Copilot should follow - just like you would if you were prompting it in chat. You can reference <code>#tools</code>, <code>#files</code>, <code>@participants</code>, other <code>/prompts</code>, and <code>#instructions</code> right here. If you ever catch yourself copying and pasting instructions between prompts, that’s your signal: split it up, give things a clear name, and keep each prompt focused on a single, repeatable workflow.</p>\n\n<p>The best reusable prompts are <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>specific</strong>, not giant copy-paste walls. If you can automate it or break it down into smaller pieces, do it! That way, you (and your team) can mix, match, and remix prompts to build bigger automations down the line - without losing your mind or having to decode a mysterious black box later.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re practicing on your own, start small and build up - tweak one thing at a time and watch how even tiny prompt or context changes can totally flip the results. Get curious about how each model handles the same task (some will surprise you, some... not so much).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💎 I’m running out of space (and you’re probably out of caffeine already), so I’ll wrap it here. Next time, I’ll dig up a few wild, more advanced prompts and show you what Copilot will - and absolutely will NOT - do without super-clear instructions.

There's not much to cover here after you know they exist and where to find them. Unless you're making friends with every MCP server and already met your \"128 selected tool\" limit, there's not much reason to mess with them much. Just make sure they're all selected and available for Copilot to execute when prompted and you're set. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my personal top-5 built-in tools, that somehow <em>always</em> manage to sneak into any reusable prompt I write:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#changes</code> gives Copilot the ability to see a git diff for your workspace</li>\n<li>\n<code>#codebase</code> all-season access to your repo (and sometimes should be more targeted, but when in doubt this is a good start!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runTests</code> is just what it sounds like and let's Copilot execute any part or all of your test suite</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runInTerminal</code> is the basic run-of-the-mill access to Copilot's very own integrated terminal (separate from yours!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#editFiles</code> is the tool Copilot needs to make any changes within your repo. If you're expecting Agent Mode to start implementing features, you're going to need this!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> In Agent mode, click the wrench (Configure Tools) at the bottom of Copilot Chat to pick exactly which tools Copilot can use.

      "body_markdown": "---\ndescription: \"An introduction to reusable prompts in GitHub Copilot — what they are, how they work, and why they’re worth adding to your dev workflow.\"\n---\n\n> 😇 Confession: I started planning this post over a month ago, got sidetracked this weekend (at least four times), half-wrote a completely different post, and only finished this one at the last minute after I started writing from the **_end_**. That’s just how it goes in my head - always at full throttle, but rarely in a straight line. 🌪️\n\n> So grab your favorite over-caffeinated iced drink (mine: grande, iced midnight, extra espresso, real vanilla cream - liquid chaos in a cup ☕️❣️) and settle in. Here’s everything I know about Copilot’s reusable prompts - Part 1.\n\n ---\n\n## Why This Isn’t Another Wall of Copilot Prompts 🧱\n\nHave you ever searched for best practices when it comes to Copilot? You usually end up with either a block that can't even be considered a whole sentence on it's own _OR_ the wall is so gigantic you don't even know where to start reading? \n\nYou're really curious though - so you dive in at the first place you see, and then last about 30 seconds... About the time all those AI lines start to blur together you think, “There’s no way anyone actually does all this in real life?”\n\nHonestly, I’m probably *that* person who wrote half the wall (or more) to begin with! Good news for you though, is that: \n  1. I'm not going to do that do you now, and \n  2. I do a great job of finding out all the things that absolutely **will not work** no matter what you try (so you don't have to!) ☺️\n\nHere's my \"boiled-down-to basics\" version of GitHub Copilot's Reusable (and still experimental) Prompts.\n\n---\n\n## ✨📁 Copilot’s File Types, Explained\n\nEver wonder how Copilot instructions and prompts show up in real life? Here’s what it actually looks like in a real project:\n\n► `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — This is your repo’s “how to act” guide for Copilot and is _always_ in context. It sets the baseline behavior for your project and tells Copilot what to expect from your workflow and contributors.\n\n    Using what you know about our current release system, write a git command to view the total number of commits pushed to main since the last tagged version.\n\n► `.github/instructions/secure-coding-principles.instruction.md` — Think of this as a reusable, specialized playbook. Use these for rules or guidelines you want Copilot to follow everywhere, or for specific situations - like always doing a security review, or making sure React code has matching tests.\n\n    With rules defined in #secure-coding-principles.instruction.md, perform a thorough code review of all staged changes. When you are finished, post a new pull request review with all your comments or suggestions for changes to meet minimum guidelines defined by this repo.\n    ---\n    With everything you know from the #rules-for-react.instruction.md, build a new component for the frontend along with unit and integration tests.\n\n► `.github/prompts/something-for-copilot-to-do-regularly.prompt.md` — This is where you automate repeatable workflows. It’s a set of step-by-step instructions Copilot can follow whenever you trigger it with a slash command in chat.\n\n    /generate-conventional-commit using only staged changes for JIRA-1234.\n\n> 🐉 Who needs to memorize Vim macros or survive Emacs keybindings when you can just hit “/” in the chat and watch Copilot handle the rest?\n\n---\n\n## Quick Review 📕\n\n> 💡 Not on VS Code (or Insiders) yet? Now’s your chance to give it a real shot - features like this hit VS Code Insiders _months_ before anywhere else. For now, it’s the best way to test reusable prompts hands-on, so go ahead and grab it if you haven’t already.\n\nI know I’ve written a lot about models - like in [AI Coding with GitHub Copilot](https://dev.to/anchildress1/build-it-better-real-world-ai-coding-with-github-copilot-1d47) and [Troubleshooting Production with GitHub Copilot](https://dev.to/anchildress1/troubleshooting-production-with-github-copilot-the-guide-for-real-humans-and-bots-with-good-taste-253o) - but I haven’t spent much time on chat modes.\n\n> 💎 And no, not the same as \"Custom Chat Modes\" (which is also super cool - I promise I’ll cover those soon!).\n\nBefore we jump in, let’s hit pause and rewind. It’s time for a quick, back-to-basics look at what actually matters when deciding what work you want Copilot to do - and how much control you want over how it gets done.\n\n---\n\n### Chat Modes at a Glance 🎛️\n\nHere’s where things get interesting: Copilot doesn’t just work in one “mode” - it’s got a whole range, from chill Q&A to full-on automation beast. Pick your mode wisely!\n\n| Mode | What It Does | When To Use | Power Level |\n| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |\n| Ask | Answers questions, suggests ideas - your personal Stack Overflow, minus the snark. | Research, quick advice, copy snippets | 🟢 Low |\n| Edit | Changes code in-place, optimized for speed—think “find and replace,” but actually smart. | Step-by-step or explicit code changes | 🟡 Medium |\n| Agent\t| Multi-step, can use tools, context, and reasoning. Give it instructions and let it run wild (within reason). | Automation, complex flows, integrations | 🔴 High |\n| Custom | Depends on it's goal from the user... so many choices! | Automation, complex flows, integrations, team magic | 💜 Extreme |\n\n> 🦄 Let me know how curious you are about these custom chat modes - I'm still experimenting and figuring out what they can (and can't) do. If you’ve got questions, wild theories, or even better, your own examples... drop them in the comments! 🚦💬\n\n---\n\n### The Gist of Models 🦾\n\n> ✨ I know, I reuse this table a lot - but hey, good models deserve a callback.\n\n| Model | Best For | Notes & Quirks |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GPT-4.1, GPT-4o | Creative debugging, “Where do I start?” | Needs hand-holding on long tasks. Free for most users. |\n| o3/4-mini, Gemini | Pattern-matching, log sleuthing | Great for “explain these logs,” not for wild creative leaps. |\n| Gemini 2.5 | Tedious but simple, long-form tasks | Decent at bulk work, rarely surprises (good or bad). |\n| Claude Sonnet 3.5–4 | Root cause, deep logic, “why did this happen?” | Loves complex analysis but rarely offers alternate approaches unless you nudge. |\n\n---\n\n### Tools for your AI 🪛\n\nVS Code comes with several tools for GitHub Copilot already built in, but you can always add more via extensions or MCP servers. There's not much to cover here after you know they exist and where to find them. Unless you're making friends with every MCP server and already met your \"128 selected tool\" limit, there's not much reason to mess with them much. Just make sure they're all selected and available for Copilot to execute when prompted and you're set. \n\nHere's my personal top-5 built-in tools, that somehow *always* manage to sneak into any reusable prompt I write:\n\n- `#changes` gives Copilot the ability to see a git diff for your workspace\n- `#codebase` all-season access to your repo (and sometimes should be more targeted, but when in doubt this is a good start!)\n- `#runTests` is just what it sounds like and let's Copilot execute any part or all of your test suite\n- `#runInTerminal` is the basic run-of-the-mill access to Copilot's very own integrated terminal (separate from yours!)\n- `#editFiles` is the tool Copilot needs to make any changes within your repo. If you're expecting Agent Mode to start implementing features, you're going to need this!\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** In Agent mode, click the wrench (Configure Tools) at the bottom of Copilot Chat to pick exactly which tools Copilot can use. If you share prompts, call out any non-default tools - just like listing dependencies.\n\n---\n\n#### Bonus Tools — More Power, More Fun 🛠️✨🎉\n\nSome of my favorite extras come from the [Atlassian MCP-Remote](https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/getting-started-with-the-atlassian-remote-mcp-server/) server, but if you have the ability to install GitHub Apps then check out [Rovo](https://github.com/marketplace/atlassian), too:\n\n- `#getJiraIssue` lets Copilot pull all the details for a story.\n- `#addCommentToJiraIssue` posts your summary as you (so add your RAI disclaimer!).\n- `#createConfluencePage` & `#updateConfluencePage` — still figuring out the best way to teach Copilot “Atlassian style” `.confluence` syntax (it’s a work in progress 🫠).\n- `#mermaid-diagram-validator` checks your diagrams with the official Mermaid extension.\n- `#copilotCodingAgent` — brand new, and I can’t wait to see what it can do! Assign it a task and let it work while you keep pairing in Copilot Chat.\n\n> 💎 [Coding Agent has serious limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/about-copilot-coding-agent), so check the docs before letting it run wild!\n\n---\n\n## 📨 Commit Message Magic: One Slash to Rule Them All\n\nHere's an example of a basic, yet realistic prompt that generates a commit message. No Jira, no testing, no terminal magic - just one clear task. This is a great way to test prompt building before layering on more steps or complicated conditional logic. \n\nIn VS Code, paste this directly into the prompts folder shown or open the command palette and search for `Chat: New Prompt File...` and then choose whether to store the prompt at the repo-level in `.github/prompts` or globally for use across all of your workspaces. \n\n\n**Prompt:** `.github/prompts/generate-commit-message.prompt.md`\n\n```markdown\n---\nmode: ask\ndescription: |\n\tThis prompt is used to generate a commit message based on changes staged in a Git repository.\ntools:\n- changes\n---\n\n# Generate Commit Changes Prompt\n\nReview all code currently staged and use your chat history, if available, to populate details about the changes. Use the information to generate a concise and informative commit message. It should follow conventional commit standards with a clear type, subject, and bullet points for details.\n```\n\n> ⚠️ **UPDATE:** The syntax posted above is actually the _second_ version available in VS Code and last night's update seems to have switched it back to the original. So, if you try to load this and see syntax errors try this instead:\n> 1. `description`: 'Enter the description in single quotes on the same line and without the `|`'\n> 2. `tools`: ['changes'] <!-- Define in an array instead of a list, with each tool name as a string -->\n\n---\n\n### Executing Reusable Prompts\n\nOnce you have this (or any other) reusable prompt stored in VS Code, use a slash command to invoke it in the chat interface. Given the above example, you'd prompt Copilot in the chat with something like\n```\n/generate-commit-message consider only staged files and generate a new commit that starts with a unique emoji\n```\n\nConsidering all the rules I have set up elsewhere outside of that reusable prompt, I still ended up with a nice clean conventional commit (for the most part).\n\n```\n🦄 chore: update commit message generation prompt for clarity\n\n• Instructs to review all staged code and use chat history for context\n• Requires concise, informative commit messages following conventional commit standards\n• Specifies format: clear type, subject, and bullet points for details\n• Ensures only staged changes are considered for commit message generation 😊👍\n```\n\n> 🦄 For this example, I actually _tried_ to make Copilot break my own repo-rules - total role reversal. Turns out, it’s stubborn! Even when I begged it to ignore my instructions and forget conventional commit standards, it flat-out refused. 🤣\n\n---\n\n## Let’s Break It Down: How a Reusable Prompt Really Works ⚡️\n\nEvery reusable prompt has exactly two parts:\n\n1. **YAML frontmatter:** Everything between the first `---` (at the top) and the next `---` marks your frontmatter.\n\n1. **Prompt instructions:** The main body - break your instructions into small, reusable chunks, just like you would with code.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip:** The more targeted your prompts and instructions, the easier they are to reuse, test, and share later. Treat them like mini code modules - precise, focused, and easy to swap out.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 YAML Frontmatter: Your Prompt’s Control Panel\n\n- **mode:** We’re using `ask` mode because we only need Copilot to generate text, not generate code or run tests.\n\n- **description:** A quick, human-friendly summary of what this prompt does. Great for organizing and sanity-checking as your prompt list grows.\n\n- **tools:** List all the tools Copilot can use when running this prompt. Keep it tight - less is usually more!\n\n- **model:** Enter the name of a model exactly as it appears in the chat model dropdown or leave this out if you want to try different ones or let the user pick. If you do specify one, Copilot will always use that model for this prompt and nothing else.\n\n> 🦄 Frontmatter isn’t actually required for your reusable prompt to work! If you leave out `mode` or `model`, Copilot just uses whatever settings the user picked in the chat. No `description`? No big deal (but it helps keep things organized). The only one to really watch: skipping `tools` — sometimes you’ll be fine, sometimes Copilot will get stuck, all depending on the user’s VS Code setup.\n\n---\n\n### 💬 Reusable-Style Prompt Engineering: Speak Human, Think Modular\n\nThe second section in your `.github/prompts/reusable-prompt.prompt.md` file is where you write out, in natural language, the exact instructions Copilot should follow - just like you would if you were prompting it in chat. You can reference `#tools`, `#files`, `@participants`, other `/prompts`, and `#instructions` right here. If you ever catch yourself copying and pasting instructions between prompts, that’s your signal: split it up, give things a clear name, and keep each prompt focused on a single, repeatable workflow.\n\nThe best reusable prompts are **modular** and **specific**, not giant copy-paste walls. If you can automate it or break it down into smaller pieces, do it! That way, you (and your team) can mix, match, and remix prompts to build bigger automations down the line - without losing your mind or having to decode a mysterious black box later.\n\nWhen you’re practicing on your own, start small and build up - tweak one thing at a time and watch how even tiny prompt or context changes can totally flip the results. Get curious about how each model handles the same task (some will surprise you, some... not so much).\n\n> 💎 I’m running out of space (and you’re probably out of caffeine already), so I’ll wrap it here.

I went with <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/github-copilot-certification-crash-course/0642572013405/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tim Warner’s at O’Reilly</a> (another work perk!)</p>\n\n<p>I expected it to be a snoozefest but nope, it’s actually engaging, and the group vibe is fun. Their class dashboard is super flexible, so get comfy for 4+ hours.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> the recordings can take up to 2 days <em>after</em> the class, so if you miss part of it, you can’t just catch up right away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"bonus-drama\" href=\"#bonus-drama\">\n  </a>\n  Bonus drama 🧠\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is also where I learned about “brain dump” practice tests. Some (like a few on Udemy) get flagged for stolen content, and if you use those, Microsoft can yank your cert <strong>for life</strong>. Not my rabbit hole, but if anyone has the actual “offenders” list, drop a link in the comments!</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"day-before-the-test\" href=\"#day-before-the-test\">\n  </a>\n  Day Before the Test 🕰️🛠️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Picture this: 10pm, my calendar looks more like a merge conflict than any form of organization, and I’ve just spent a half-day in a prep class (which was great, but just pointed out all the things I <em>thought</em> I knew and needed to go double-check). </p>\n\n<p>Then there's my test space setup: I’m crammed into the tiniest corner of my house — the only space far enough from everyone else, where I can shut the door and (hopefully) not be interrupted. My not-quite-center desk barely fits, squeezed between the footboard and the wall, and there’s just enough room for me, my laptop, and a single can of Coke.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not that it was uncomfortable once I got myself situated, but any form of movement meant I was hitting something (mainly myself) on the desk or bed  🛏️💻🪑</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You won't want to wait until the last minute like I did, but also, there’s no need to set up a week early. The actual system test:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download zip &gt; Unzip &gt; Open &gt; Start.</li>\n<li>Wait... spinner... okay, done.</li>\n<li>Mic, sound, webcam. Check. </li>\n<li>Internet + background system. Check.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Don’t use your work computer unless you’re a full admin, with VPN OFF, and you can give <em>full system control</em> to the test app. Restart for a clean slate, and skip the “reopen windows” part. Paperwork? Nada. Until you actually check in. 🗂️</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The truth?</strong> My work laptop was more than fine. They stressed the point until I began to worry, but 0 issues. However, I get pretty much free reign with it. If your's is locked up tighter than admin? You could have issues!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"test-day\" href=\"#test-day\">\n  </a>\n  Test Day 🎬😎\n</h2>\n\n<p>When you register, it defaults to an ungodly early time slot — but you can change it to what works for you. (Unless you are that <em><strong>weird morning person</strong></em> who's usually awake with the sun — you know who you are — just a friendly callout payback 😇).</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"signin\" href=\"#signin\">\n  </a>\n  Sign-In 🛎️🔑\n</h3>\n\n<p>You can sign in up to 30 minutes early. But the second you open that VUE test app, you’re stuck: no phone, no other apps, no moving. Meaning early birds get to wait longer; last-minute folks like me rush in, power nap, and join the waiting line just in time.</p>\n\n<p>After everyone’s in the system:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download app (fresh), system test (again), green light.</li>\n<li><strong>Scan your test space</strong></li>\n<li>Begin exam</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules\" href=\"#the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules\">\n  </a>\n  The Picture Game: My Desk, My Rules 🖼️🥤\n</h3>\n\n<p>Pearson wants 7 pictures, all from your phone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You, against a solid background. Easy. </li>\n<li>ID, front and back, on a dark surface. Done.</li>\n<li>Workspace: front, back, left, right...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Insert where I made my first mistake — the Pearson Vue phone app lists strict instructions for <em>how</em> they want these pictures. They give you a little diagram to tell you exactly where they want you in relationship to the space when you snap the picture. I'm looking at it and studying... knowing good and well this is not going to work for what they want, but the rules said stand on X so I get as close to X as I can without acrobatics and snap the picture.</p>\n\n<p>Next the \"greeter\" came online (these are the people responsible for making sure your test area meets all criteria for taking the online exam) and of course the pictures aren't clear enough. So we go through the whole “spin around” and show the whole room. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, it’s a live-action improv skit: me, my laptop, and the world’s smallest mouse trap of a space. Yes, Pearson, it's just a Coke. No, there’s nothing else hiding in here unless you count my dignity — which definitely disappeared between picture three and four. 🙈🫠</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3\" href=\"#exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3\">\n  </a>\n  Exam Begins: More Dramatics Ensue 🫣🎭\n</h3>\n\n<p>Now that's out of the way, we can get down to business. <strong>Ready, set, go!</strong> Instructions pop up first (read them again). Timer (hide it if you want to stay sane). And Begin. ⏱️</p>\n\n<p>I’m focused, in the zone — then, out of nowhere: <strong>Click. “Is there someone in the room with you?”</strong> Me, blinking at the screen: “No... Oh, wait, I was just talking to myself! I swear I never read a question ou–\" Click. Chat window: “Continue the exam.” 😅</p>\n\n<p>Well.. alright then. I guess we're good. Five minutes later — interrupted <strong>again</strong>: “If you don’t stop talking, I’ll cancel your exam.” <em>WHAT?!</em> “Okay! Not a problem — I'll stop.\" 🤐</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I really could have used a break. Microsoft policy explicitly allows unscheduled breaks (timer keeps running, can’t revisit earlier questions). But... I needed to review everything before submitting, so I just clammed up and finished. It was painful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the time the exam was over I'm super antsy — energy is boiling over from the long stretch of silence — but the only thing left is exactly 7 questions I've flagged for feedback to Microsoft (this is the only way you're allowed to mention anything about specific questions after the test is finished). Checked the timer — 20 minutes left — perfect! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>I told the proctor, “I’m taking a quick break, answers are all submitted.” Stepped five feet away, and suddenly, a <em>new</em> proctor:<br>\n“Hello? Are you there? You need to be in front of the camera!” Door open, I explained, “Just the restroom, all submitted!” “You can’t leave the view of the camera.” Well, I <em>know</em> they didn't want me to take the computer with me — so honestly, what did they want me to do? 😲</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confession:</strong> I was so done with being polite at that point. I'm already jumping out of my skin from the roaring silence for more than an hour. Now even though Microsoft’s policy says unscheduled breaks are allowed at any point, I'm getting threatened for no reason I can discern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After three rounds of “You can’t leave!” with \"But I'm already finished. It's just the feedback.\" I gave up. “Alright – fine! No feedback, then.” Click. Click. Done. ...Crickets. 🦗</p>\n\n<p>I sat there, stunned. Camera turned off, grade popped up — yes, I passed, but <strong>seriously, <em>what just happened</em>?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Later, I went digging and found a Microsoft blog post from 2022 that clearly shows: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>⏸️ Take a Break<code>&lt;/button&gt;</code><br>\nDid my exam have a break button? NOPE. Well then, <em>THAT</em> explains it. 😑🙃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"moral-of-the-story\" href=\"#moral-of-the-story\">\n  </a>\n  Moral of the Story 💬\n</h2>\n\n<p>I left a very thorough explanation in Pearson VUE’s feedback form. Yes, I was frustrated, but this isn’t about the proctors or the greeters — they were never rude. It’s either training, documentation, or both! </p>\n\n<p>I wish my voice would have made it to Microsoft, because I had <em>plenty to say</em> about their process and I had spent precious time preparing to do so! Now I just hope the next person either gets that missing break button — or at least they update the docs!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Would I do it again?</strong> Absolutely! Things happen. This is my dramatic version of events so you don’t have to repeat my mistakes (and hopefully had a little fun along the way). Besides — ultimately, I got exactly what I wanted when I started! 💞✨</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"nightmare-testing\" href=\"#nightmare-testing\">\n  </a>\n  Nightmare Testing? 🤪\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you (or someone you know) have an “unexpected twist” or “oddly sideways” certification or exam story — please share it below! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, don’t leave me hanging as the only one with this kind of experience? 🙏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"this-was-not-a-solo-quest-\" href=\"#this-was-not-a-solo-quest-\">\n  </a>\n  🛡️ This was not a solo quest —\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"chatgpt-tagged-along-for-the-ride\" href=\"#chatgpt-tagged-along-for-the-ride\">\n  </a>\n  ChatGPT tagged along for the ride 🤖🧑‍💻\n</h3>\n\n<p><em>The content in this post is 100% mine, just censored and sweetened with ChatGPT</em> 🍬✨</p>\n\n",

      "body_markdown": "---\ndescription: \"New as of July 2025: GitHub Copilot certification now runs on Pearson VUE. How I registered, what to expect on exam day, rules, gotchas, and a few funny moments.\"\n---\n\n[![Ashley's Copilot Certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchildress1/checkmark-icons/refs/heads/gh-pages/misc/ashley-copilot-certification.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/anchildress1/1121633CBF5C85C?sharingId=60F9D8D3EC60E986)\n\n---\n\nOkay, technically, I’ve known this was coming for a while, and honestly, I’ve felt ready even longer than that. Yes, I celebrated with a gift Leonardo subscription to myself. (I’ll be way more excited about it once those 429 errors slow down enough for me to actually play with it again.) \n\nSeriously — if you’re even considering Leonardo: it’s exploding right now, but if you’re like me (dev brain: ‘ooh, code banners!’), know that Leonardo is _pure artist_. Artists and devs? Different planets, sometimes.\n\n> 🎨 The first time I tossed it a dev prompt: “I need a banner image representing a group of diverse engineers upgrading Java with Copilot.” I expected... I dunno, coffee? Maybe a way-too-big wrench? Instead: **FOUR wildly different, amazing steampunk apocalypse scenes with a diverse squad running away from a tank the size of a data center.** 🤣\n>\n> Yes, Leonardo — sometimes I _do_ feel like that with Java, but it wasn’t exactly what I had in mind! Still, totally worth it just to immortalize Java as the official steampunk language. 🚂⚙️\n\nBut let’s set art aside, because:\n\n**I did it! I am now officially GitHub Copilot certified!** 🫶\n\nThis one’s been on my list _forever_, but once Microsoft announced their plan to switch everything to Pearson VUE, I gave it a month before risking the “please excuse our growing pains” phase. So, here we are!\n\n> **Spoiler:** They’re still ironing out the kinks. The test itself? Needs work, but passable. The VUE app? Good, even though they made me download it twice, because why not. 🤷‍♀️\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- **Pearson Vue online process:** Better than expected! (Not 100% bug-free, but not a disaster.) 👍\n- **O’Reilly Copilot prep course:** Absolutely worth it (and also pointed out all the places I thought I knew but really needed to revisit) 📚\n- **Giving them a month to get their act together?** LOL. Nope. Not nearly enough to fix all the quirks between the doc and real life. ⏳\n- **I’ll follow up soon** with an actual step-by-step for anyone prepping for the GitHub Copilot Certification exam (spoiler: bring snacks — you’ll be reading a lot of documentation!) 🍿📝\n\n---\n\n## Testing Signup & Study Materials 🖥️📄\n\nI signed up via Microsoft Learn (work perk!). The sign-up process was so simple I forgot it even happened. Then I intentionally ignored the looming test until the last second — do not recommend, unless you’re also a chronic Copilot abuser (also not recommended!)\n\nMicrosoft will port you to Pearson VUE for the real process. Pro tip: for _THIS_ step, do whatever Microsoft tells you. (Only this step. Later? All bets are off.)\n\n> **Super important:** If you use a work/corporate Microsoft account, also link your personal one! You’ll still get work discounts, but your certification stays with you — not the company. Seriously, you do NOT want to have to re-earn this badge if you switch jobs.\n\nIf you’re testing online: Read Pearson’s test space policy. You need an enclosed room, one monitor/laptop, and 3 hours of zero interruptions. Those “bathroom test” legends? No longer allowed. No refunds either if you try it and get booted.\n\n---\n\n## Do the Certification Prep + Study! 📚💡\n\nFirst thing — take a prep course! I went with [Tim Warner’s at O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/github-copilot-certification-crash-course/0642572013405/) (another work perk!)\n\nI expected it to be a snoozefest but nope, it’s actually engaging, and the group vibe is fun. Their class dashboard is super flexible, so get comfy for 4+ hours.\n\n> ⚠️ **Warning:** the recordings can take up to 2 days _after_ the class, so if you miss part of it, you can’t just catch up right away.\n\n### Bonus drama 🧠\n\nThis is also where I learned about “brain dump” practice tests. Some (like a few on Udemy) get flagged for stolen content, and if you use those, Microsoft can yank your cert **for life**. Not my rabbit hole, but if anyone has the actual “offenders” list, drop a link in the comments!\n\n---\n\n## Day Before the Test 🕰️🛠️\n\nPicture this: 10pm, my calendar looks more like a merge conflict than any form of organization, and I’ve just spent a half-day in a prep class (which was great, but just pointed out all the things I _thought_ I knew and needed to go double-check). \n\nThen there's my test space setup: I’m crammed into the tiniest corner of my house — the only space far enough from everyone else, where I can shut the door and (hopefully) not be interrupted. My not-quite-center desk barely fits, squeezed between the footboard and the wall, and there’s just enough room for me, my laptop, and a single can of Coke.\n\n> Not that it was uncomfortable once I got myself situated, but any form of movement meant I was hitting something (mainly myself) on the desk or bed  🛏️💻🪑\n\nYou won't want to wait until the last minute like I did, but also, there’s no need to set up a week early. The actual system test:\n\n1. Download zip > Unzip > Open > Start.\n1. Wait... spinner... okay, done.\n1. Mic, sound, webcam. Check. \n1. Internet + background system. Check.\n\nDon’t use your work computer unless you’re a full admin, with VPN OFF, and you can give _full system control_ to the test app. Restart for a clean slate, and skip the “reopen windows” part. Paperwork? Nada. Until you actually check in. 🗂️\n\n> **The truth?** My work laptop was more than fine. They stressed the point until I began to worry, but 0 issues. However, I get pretty much free reign with it. If your's is locked up tighter than admin? You could have issues!\n\n## Test Day 🎬😎\n\nWhen you register, it defaults to an ungodly early time slot — but you can change it to what works for you. (Unless you are that _**weird morning person**_ who's usually awake with the sun — you know who you are — just a friendly callout payback 😇).\n\n### Sign-In 🛎️🔑\n\nYou can sign in up to 30 minutes early. But the second you open that VUE test app, you’re stuck: no phone, no other apps, no moving. Meaning early birds get to wait longer; last-minute folks like me rush in, power nap, and join the waiting line just in time.\n\nAfter everyone’s in the system:\n\n1. Download app (fresh), system test (again), green light.\n1. **Scan your test space**\n1. Begin exam\n\n---\n\n### The Picture Game: My Desk, My Rules 🖼️🥤\n\nPearson wants 7 pictures, all from your phone:\n\n- You, against a solid background. Easy. \n- ID, front and back, on a dark surface. Done.\n- Workspace: front, back, left, right...\n\nInsert where I made my first mistake — the Pearson Vue phone app lists strict instructions for _how_ they want these pictures. They give you a little diagram to tell you exactly where they want you in relationship to the space when you snap the picture. I'm looking at it and studying... knowing good and well this is not going to work for what they want, but the rules said stand on X so I get as close to X as I can without acrobatics and snap the picture.\n\nNext the \"greeter\" came online (these are the people responsible for making sure your test area meets all criteria for taking the online exam) and of course the pictures aren't clear enough. So we go through the whole “spin around” and show the whole room. \n\n> Honestly, it’s a live-action improv skit: me, my laptop, and the world’s smallest mouse trap of a space. Yes, Pearson, it's just a Coke. No, there’s nothing else hiding in here unless you count my dignity — which definitely disappeared between picture three and four. 🙈🫠\n\n---\n\n### Exam Begins: More Dramatics Ensue 🫣🎭\n\nNow that's out of the way, we can get down to business. **Ready, set, go!** Instructions pop up first (read them again). Timer (hide it if you want to stay sane). And Begin. ⏱️\n\nI’m focused, in the zone — then, out of nowhere: **Click. “Is there someone in the room with you?”** Me, blinking at the screen: “No...

Honestly, I invested <em>just enough</em> to know whether or not to change my strategy before shouting it to the rest of the company. That was the sum total of my initial intent.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"fast-forward\" href=\"#fast-forward\">\n  </a>\n  Fast forward\n</h2>\n\n<p>I somehow ended up with <strong>actual people followers</strong> (you know — <em>real people</em>, not bots!). Now these posts are going to LinkedIn too (thanks for starting that <a class=\"mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/georgekobaidze\">@georgekobaidze</a>!) Eventually, I’ll get them back to Confluence where they were supposed to be originally anyway (although this is definitely <em>way more fun</em>)! 🤩</p>\n\n<p>So, sincerely — thank you to everyone who’s encouraged or supported me along the way. I wouldn’t still be writing these without you! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if you’re just lurking in the background — I see you, too. 👀 <br>\nYou be you. Just don’t be afraid to join the party sometimes, yeah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After a couple months of posting, I’ve realized this blog isn’t going anywhere. And even though Dev.to is super casual, I didn’t want to start shouting into the void at random without first setting a <em>tiny</em> bit of structure. 🤏</p>\n\n<p>Plus, I work better under pressure. So think of this next part as my self-applied <strong>anti-procrastination machine</strong> fueled by too much caffeine. ⏱️☕</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-weekly-copilot-posts\" href=\"#1-weekly-copilot-posts\">\n  </a>\n  📅 1. Weekly Copilot Posts\n</h3>\n\n<p>Every Wednesday morning(ish), expect a new post diving into my current favorite topic: GitHub Copilot.

That could be lunchtime in London, dinnertime in Delhi, or “oops I overslept (<em>again</em>)” on the East Coast. ⏰</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> It’s not that I <em>can’t</em> schedule them at the exact same time every week... it just physically hurts to not sprinkle in a little \"unpredictable\" (welcome to my brain!) I might be able to handle the structure, but I need that tiny piece of random to keep my inner Loki happy. 🦊</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So - <strong>same-ish time every Wednesday = GitHub Copilot</strong>, give or take an hour from 8AM EDT.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-surprise-posts-like-this\" href=\"#2-surprise-posts-like-this\">\n  </a>\n  🌪️ 2.

Even I don't know when a moment will strike! Like this one (and the other few random thoughts in my ChatGPT that are sure to follow soon).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the unannounced bursts of “I have thoughts and <em>SOMEBODY</em> should listen!” But mostly driven by the tiny Gremlin at the keyboard that occasionally hijacks my routine just for fun. 👾</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that's my \"un-officially official\" plan — no backing out now.

What follows is nearly identical to my replies to those posts - plus a quick summary of the original articles (so you don’t need to click and give them extra views; trust me, you’re not missing anything) - along with my own perspective, so you know just how strongly I feel about this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to copy, share, and amplify. Let’s work together to push back against this kind of fear-mongering and make it clear to every person - young or old: <strong>mental health struggles are never your fault.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"first-a-psa-for-anyone-who-needs-it\" href=\"#first-a-psa-for-anyone-who-needs-it\">\n  </a>\n  First, a PSA for anyone who needs it:\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis <strong>in the U.S., you can call <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">988</a></strong> anytime, day or night, for free support. 988 is for any topic, offers support in English and Spanish (interpreters for other languages), and lets you talk, text, chat online, or use VP. There’s even a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/support-education/nami-helpline/teen-young-adult-helpline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teen &amp; Young Adult Helpline (#TalktoUs)</a> with peer support - again, all free and confidential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you’re outside the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/find-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HelpGuide.org</a> lists helplines for several other countries</strong>, including the UK, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines, Ireland, Australia, Canada, and India. It’s not global (yet), but it’s a start.</p>\n\n<p>It’s <em>critical</em> to recognize warning signs for early mental health crisis intervention and know how to support someone who might be experiencing first-episode psychosis (often seen in teens and young adults prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia). Hallucinations and delusions are well-known symptoms, but early signs <strong>can also look like depression</strong>. There’s no cure, but schizophrenia and related disorders are very treatable - and treatment today usually means medication and counseling, not hospitals or “scary” interventions. Some helpful resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/what-is-mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SAMHSA: Schizophrenia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI: About Schizophrenia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NIMH: Statistics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nami.org/press-releases/the-michael-laudor-tragedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI: The Michael Laudor Tragedy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"now-to-the-posts\" href=\"#now-to-the-posts\">\n  </a>\n  Now, to the posts\n</h2>\n\n<p>The central claim of these posts is that the rapid adoption and widespread, frequent use of AI - particularly chatbots like ChatGPT - is responsible for what the author describes as a rise in mental health disorders among teens and young adults. While the term “psychosis” is used (rather than “schizophrenia”), the narrative strongly implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship that simply isn’t supported by research.</p>\n\n<p>The author includes an anecdote about a young person who used ChatGPT as a sort of “friend,” supposedly leading them to blur the lines between technology and reality.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"my-biggest-problem-with-this\" href=\"#my-biggest-problem-with-this\">\n  </a>\n  My Biggest Problem with This\n</h2>\n\n<p>This conversation is so important - but let’s clear something up: blaming AI (or any single thing) for youth mental health or psychosis isn’t just misleading; it’s flat-out <em>unhelpful</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we take the story at face value (there’s no supporting evidence or sources provided, so that’s a <em>big if</em>), <strong>it is absolutely NOT their fault!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The mere <em>suggestion</em> that a serious, life-altering condition like psychosis could be caused by something a person - young or old - did or didn’t do is not just <em>incorrect</em> and <em>unhelpful</em>, it’s <em><strong>dangerous</strong></em>. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of thinking is exactly why so many people are hesitant to seek help: they feel like it’s something they “brought on themselves” or could have prevented. The truth is, it’s not anyone’s fault - least of all your own.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-truth-about-psychosis\" href=\"#the-truth-about-psychosis\">\n  </a>\n  The Truth about Psychosis\n</h2>\n\n<p>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders typically first appear in teens and young adults, but that’s not because of the latest tech trend.</p>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been true long before anyone worried about AI, TikTok, or even Pac-Man.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>teams</em> of experts actively researching what causes psychosis - technology is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle that includes genetics, environment, stress, trauma, and yes, sometimes technology use (in many forms).</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2817594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2024 study</a> found only a <strong>modest link</strong> between higher computer use in mid-teen years and later psychotic experiences, and even that was mostly explained by other risk factors (mental health and social challenges were present <em>before</em> the high computer use). No clear “cause and effect,” just a reminder that life is complicated and brains even more so.</p>\n\n<p>This is a serious medical topic. Blaming TV, games, the internet, or AI for psychosis is the same tired playbook people have used for decades, and it only makes it harder for people to ask for help. Mental illness is never as simple as a single cause, and fear-mongering or finger-pointing helps no one.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-this-is-important-to-me\" href=\"#why-this-is-important-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Why This Is Important to Me\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"those-closest-to-me\" href=\"#those-closest-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Those Closest to Me\n</h3>\n\n<p>I grew up with someone in my household who had an untreated mental health condition. It wasn’t schizophrenia, but it deeply shaped my world from my earliest memories. It wasn’t “good” or “bad” - it was simply normal for me. Years later, after I was grown, they finally received help. I wish I could say it was a storybook turnaround. There were good stretches, and some not-so-good ones. Did all those years without support play a role in how things are now? I can’t say for sure - but I know it didn’t help.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"my-own-journey\" href=\"#my-own-journey\">\n  </a>\n  My Own Journey\n</h3>\n\n<p>I was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition in my early twenties (and I’m always willing to talk about it privately if anyone needs support - just reach out). Honestly, I felt “different” long before I ever got the diagnosis. I couldn’t quite name it, and for a long time I just assumed I was “off” in some way. Admitting there might be a problem took a <em>long</em> time; actually seeking help took <em>even longer</em> and was often inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until college, when I signed up for free counseling sessions (for reasons I can’t even remember - probably thanks to a sibling who worked in the office), that things started to shift. My counselor, Maggie, was the definition of approachable and probably saved my life more than once. One of the first things she did was encourage more frequent sessions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A quick PSA:</strong> Finding the right counselor or therapist can be pure luck - or it can take a lot of searching. If you tried once and it didn’t click, don’t give up. Your “Maggie” is out there, but you’ll never meet them if you don’t keep looking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with counseling for a long time (in addition to other treatment). Life eventually took us in different directions, and it hasn’t always been as easy since, but I learned how to show up for myself and talk about it. Some days I’m better at it than others, but overall, I’m a happy, healthy adult - and, most importantly, I finally <em>feel</em> normal.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"ripple-effects\" href=\"#ripple-effects\">\n  </a>\n  Ripple Effects\n</h3>\n\n<p>Out of respect for my family’s privacy, I won’t go deep here. But as an adult, I’ve seen firsthand how mental health issues can affect not just individuals, but entire families - even those who don’t live under the same roof. The big lesson: it’s not just okay to talk about mental health and seek help - <strong>it’s essential</strong>. The person in my life who struggled is doing much better now, thanks to a treatment plan that worked for them and continued care.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\" href=\"#be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\">\n  </a>\n  Be Part of the Solution to Mental Health\n</h2>\n\n<p>Mental health struggles - crisis or not - are <em>never</em> caused by one thing, and they’re never solved by one thing. It takes understanding, openness, and the willingness to address tough topics. Spreading rumors or horror stories like “ChatGPT made her crazy!” only hurts people who are already suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please, be part of the solution. Share. Talk. Show up. Somebody needs it more than you know.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s focus on compassion, understanding, and <em>real</em> support for those struggling - not easy answers or scapegoats. 💛</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🛡️ This post was created with compassion, understanding, and the help of ChatGPT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",

Some with more context, some with less. I've gotten some great results and some spectacular failures! Here's an overview of what I found works for nearly every scenario when using GitHub Copilot Agent mode as a pair implementation specialist.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"tldr\" href=\"#tldr\">\n  </a>\n  📌 TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Set up repo-level instructions &amp; starter template</li>\n<li>Know your goal &amp; break tasks into stories</li>\n<li>Explore options in Ask mode for planning</li>\n<li>Design a comprehensive, context-rich prompt</li>\n<li>Spell out rules, conventions &amp; self-review steps</li>\n<li>Choose the right AI model for each task</li>\n<li>Require a self-review pass</li>\n<li>Supervise your AI pair—pause &amp; redirect</li>\n<li>Review &amp; refine changes like a seasoned engineer</li>\n<li>Provide feedback, reprompt &amp; repeat</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-set-up-repolevel-instructions\" href=\"#1-set-up-repolevel-instructions\">\n  </a>\n  1. Set Up Repo-Level Instructions\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Repo instructions give Copilot the context it needs before any new code exists. This is your baseline and everything from here on will depend on this. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔁 If you missed it, check out my previous post <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress11/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7\">All I’ve Learned About GitHub Copilot Instructions (So Far)</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you're starting a brand new project, use a starter template to scaffold basic structure and create a minimum set of instructions that includes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Project Overview</td>\n<td>What does this repo do?

Add your experience below!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Documentation</td>\n<td>Javadoc, README, Swagger/OpenAPI specs.</td>\n<td>✨ If you want something a little more advanced, look into mermaid diagrams!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Design &amp; Security</td>\n<td>Architecture constraints, naming conventions, auth rules.</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Review Rules</td>\n<td>Checklist for self-reviews and criteria for acceptance.</td>\n<td>This step will save you a ton of time in the long run.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"2-know-your-goal-amp-break-it-down\" href=\"#2-know-your-goal-amp-break-it-down\">\n  </a>\n  2. Know Your Goal &amp; Break It Down\n</h2>\n\n<p>✨ Side-project vibe-code?<br>\n🛠️ Production bug fix?<br>\n🌀 Somewhere in between?</p>\n\n<p>Define your end goal, then split work into small, targeted stories that Copilot can handle one step at a time. If a task can be broken down further, do so - you’ll get better results. The smaller and more targeted you define the task, the better results you’ll get in the end.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip</strong>: Give Copilot access to your issue tracker via an MCP server. That's one less thing to copy/paste and you can add an update clause in your prompt to let Copilot handle the comments and even issue tracking status or labels directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"3-explore-in-ask-mode\" href=\"#3-explore-in-ask-mode\">\n  </a>\n  3. Explore in Ask Mode\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you know exactly how, why, and where, then you can probably skip this step. Otherwise, before coding, do a little exploring with Copilot Ask mode.

Design a Comprehensive Prompt\n</h2>\n\n<p>Consider how you want to prompt Copilot to complete its task. For a high-impact production fix, you will probably want to keep a tight leash on the exact implementation. The more straightforward the prompt and instructions are, the less room Copilot has to veer off its intended path or hallucinate a better implementation than the one you had planned. </p>\n\n<p>Your prompt should include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Specific <code>#file</code> or <code>#selection</code> that is relevant to the task</li>\n<li>Open any related or secondary files in the editor as additional context</li>\n<li>A numbered list of implementation steps, if you need better control or visibility along the way.</li>\n<li>Specify any important design patterns, security concerns, or future work planned (can also be separate <code>.github/instructions/specific-guidelines.instruction.md</code> files in the repo for ultimate reusability.</li>\n<li>Identify any important config files (like <code>./eslint.config.js</code> or <code>./vitest.config.js</code>) that Copilot must adhere to and put them in context with #file.</li>\n<li>For complex tasks, add an extra step instructing Copilot to consider at least X alternative approaches before starting work. Assess whether the detailed implementation plan covers all edge cases and error scenarios appropriately. If not, then update accordingly before moving on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It's always better to be more specific and more strict than to provide no guidance at all. If that means your prompt is closer to the size of a 3-page essay, then that's OK! Try it out and make changes later, if needed.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"example-prompt\" href=\"#example-prompt\">\n  </a>\n  ‼️ Example prompt:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight

Set Up Repo-Level Instructions\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Repo instructions give Copilot the context it needs before any new code exists. This is your baseline and everything from here on will depend on this. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔁 If you missed it, check out my previous post <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress11/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7\">All I’ve Learned About GitHub Copilot Instructions (So Far)</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you're starting a brand new project, use a starter template to scaffold basic structure and create a minimum set of instructions that includes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Project Overview</td>\n<td>What does this repo do?

Know Your Goal &amp; Break It Down\n</h2>\n\n<p>✨ Side-project vibe-code?<br>\n🛠️ Production bug fix?<br>\n🌀 Somewhere in between?</p>\n\n<p>Define your end goal, then split work into small, targeted stories that Copilot can handle one step at a time. If a task can be broken down further, do so - you’ll get better results. The smaller and more targeted you define the task, the better results you’ll get in the end.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip</strong>: Give Copilot access to your issue tracker via an MCP server. That's one less thing to copy/paste and you can add an update clause in your prompt to let Copilot handle the comments and even issue tracking status or labels directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"3-explore-in-ask-mode\" href=\"#3-explore-in-ask-mode\">\n  </a>\n  3. Explore in Ask Mode\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you know exactly how, why, and where, then you can probably skip this step. Otherwise, before coding, do a little exploring with Copilot Ask mode. Prompt it with something like:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>Given requirements in JIRA-123, analyze #codebase and propose 3 implementation options with pros/cons. Score each by simplicity &amp; maintainability. Recommend one.\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Iterate until uncertainties are surfaced and addressed. This is also the perfect time to validate your setup, including the story itself and custom instructions. Ask yourself, is the result what you expected it to be? If not, can you pinpoint which detail was unclear or too complex?</p>\n\n<p>This is not only a great time to improve your custom instructions and story definition, but also explore alternative approaches. You might even think of something you wouldn't have otherwise. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Be careful</strong> with overconfident models. Sometimes you will read an explanation presented with such a high degree of certainty that you’ll catch yourself agreeing with it regardless of whether it actually makes sense for your use case.</p>\n\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip</strong>: Ask mode is perfect for exploration. It prevents Copilot from making changes to the code before you’re ready and it saves a premium request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"4-design-a-comprehensive-prompt\" href=\"#4-design-a-comprehensive-prompt\">\n  </a>\n  4. Design a Comprehensive Prompt\n</h2>\n\n<p>Consider how you want to prompt Copilot to complete its task. For a high-impact production fix, you will probably want to keep a tight leash on the exact implementation. The more straightforward the prompt and instructions are, the less room Copilot has to veer off its intended path or hallucinate a better implementation than the one you had planned. </p>\n\n<p>Your prompt should include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Specific <code>#file</code> or <code>#selection</code> that is relevant to the task</li>\n<li>Open any related or secondary files in the editor as additional context</li>\n<li>A numbered list of implementation steps, if you need better control or visibility along the way.</li>\n<li>Specify any important design patterns, security concerns, or future work planned (can also be separate <code>.github/instructions/specific-guidelines.instruction.md</code> files in the repo for ultimate reusability.</li>\n<li>Identify any important config files (like <code>./eslint.config.js</code> or <code>./vitest.config.js</code>) that Copilot must adhere to and put them in context with #file.</li>\n<li>For complex tasks, add an extra step instructing Copilot to consider at least X alternative approaches before starting work. Assess whether the detailed implementation plan covers all edge cases and error scenarios appropriately. If not, then update accordingly before moving on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It's always better to be more specific and more strict than to provide no guidance at all. If that means your prompt is closer to the size of a 3-page essay, then that's OK! Try it out and make changes later, if needed.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"example-prompt\" href=\"#example-prompt\">\n  </a>\n  ‼️ Example prompt:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight

      "body_markdown": "> Originally shared as an internal how-to document.\n\n## GitHub Copilot as a true pair programmer\n\nI've spent a lot of time testing workflows, instructions and prompts. Some with more context, some with less. I've gotten some great results and some spectacular failures! Here's an overview of what I found works for nearly every scenario when using GitHub Copilot Agent mode as a pair implementation specialist.\n\n## 📌 TL;DR\n\n1. Set up repo-level instructions & starter template\n1. Know your goal & break tasks into stories\n1. Explore options in Ask mode for planning\n1. Design a comprehensive, context-rich prompt\n1. Spell out rules, conventions & self-review steps\n1. Choose the right AI model for each task\n1. Require a self-review pass\n1. Supervise your AI pair—pause & redirect\n1. Review & refine changes like a seasoned engineer\n1. Provide feedback, reprompt & repeat\n\n---\n\n## 1. Set Up Repo-Level Instructions\n\n**Why it matters**: Repo instructions give Copilot the context it needs before any new code exists. This is your baseline and everything from here on will depend on this. \n\n> 🔁 If you missed it, check out my previous post [All I’ve Learned About GitHub Copilot Instructions (So Far)](https://dev.to/anchildress11/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7).\n\nIf you're starting a brand new project, use a starter template to scaffold basic structure and create a minimum set of instructions that includes:\n\n|Category|Description|Notes|\n|---|---|---|\n|Project Overview| What does this repo do? Why does it matter?||\n|Testing Requirements|TDD strategy, code coverage %, test types, error handling, edge cases.|I never had a great opportunity to test Copilot's reaction to TDD. Add your experience below!|\n|Documentation|Javadoc, README, Swagger/OpenAPI specs.| ✨ If you want something a little more advanced, look into mermaid diagrams!|\n|Design & Security|Architecture constraints, naming conventions, auth rules.||\n|Review Rules|Checklist for self-reviews and criteria for acceptance.|This step will save you a ton of time in the long run.|\n\n---\n\n## 2. Know Your Goal & Break It Down\n\n✨ Side-project vibe-code?\n🛠️ Production bug fix?\n🌀 Somewhere in between?\n\nDefine your end goal, then split work into small, targeted stories that Copilot can handle one step at a time. If a task can be broken down further, do so - you’ll get better results. The smaller and more targeted you define the task, the better results you’ll get in the end.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: Give Copilot access to your issue tracker via an MCP server. That's one less thing to copy/paste and you can add an update clause in your prompt to let Copilot handle the comments and even issue tracking status or labels directly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Explore in Ask Mode\n\nIf you know exactly how, why, and where, then you can probably skip this step. Otherwise, before coding, do a little exploring with Copilot Ask mode. Prompt it with something like:\n\n```markdown\nGiven requirements in JIRA-123, analyze #codebase and propose 3 implementation options with pros/cons. Score each by simplicity & maintainability. Recommend one.\n```\n\nIterate until uncertainties are surfaced and addressed. This is also the perfect time to validate your setup, including the story itself and custom instructions. Ask yourself, is the result what you expected it to be? If not, can you pinpoint which detail was unclear or too complex?\n\nThis is not only a great time to improve your custom instructions and story definition, but also explore alternative approaches. You might even think of something you wouldn't have otherwise. \n\n> ⚠️ **Be careful** with overconfident models. Sometimes you will read an explanation presented with such a high degree of certainty that you’ll catch yourself agreeing with it regardless of whether it actually makes sense for your use case.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: Ask mode is perfect for exploration. It prevents Copilot from making changes to the code before you’re ready and it saves a premium request.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Design a Comprehensive Prompt\n\nConsider how you want to prompt Copilot to complete its task. For a high-impact production fix, you will probably want to keep a tight leash on the exact implementation. The more straightforward the prompt and instructions are, the less room Copilot has to veer off its intended path or hallucinate a better implementation than the one you had planned. \n\nYour prompt should include:\n1. Specific `#file` or `#selection` that is relevant to the task\n1. Open any related or secondary files in the editor as additional context\n1. A numbered list of implementation steps, if you need better control or visibility along the way.\n1. Specify any important design patterns, security concerns, or future work planned (can also be separate `.github/instructions/specific-guidelines.instruction.md` files in the repo for ultimate reusability.\n1. Identify any important config files (like `./eslint.config.js` or `./vitest.config.js`) that Copilot must adhere to and put them in context with #file.\n1. For complex tasks, add an extra step instructing Copilot to consider at least X alternative approaches before starting work. Assess whether the detailed implementation plan covers all edge cases and error scenarios appropriately. If not, then update accordingly before moving on.\n\nIt's always better to be more specific and more strict than to provide no guidance at all. If that means your prompt is closer to the size of a 3-page essay, then that's OK! Try it out and make changes later, if needed.\n\n### ‼️ Example prompt:\n\n```javascript\nAssess this #codebase in conjunction with the #file:README.md. Use #githubRepo tool to reference other codebases, as needed. \nWithout making any changes to the existing code, generate a new PROJECT_DIAGRAM.md file that correctly illustrates a mermaid diagram for this repository. \nAdhere to the following guidelines:\n1. The primary project diagram should be a very high-level and only include inputs, major functionality/business logic/outputs. \n   If it links to a separate project, those should be well documented.\n2. For each primary use case you can identify, generate a diagram for it that includes enough detail to document the process end to end, \n   but leave out any irrelevant processing or \"common sense\" logic. \n3. Every diagram should have its own section that includes the mermaid diagram itself, a brief description of its purpose, \n   any external factors or links, troubleshooting steps for common failures, and suggested future improvements,\n   if any exist, that would improve maintainability or eliminate potential bugs.\n4. Ensure this new project_diagram is linked to from the primary #file:README.md\n```\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: Mermaid diagrams are a great addition to any `README.md` and GitHub renders them without any help on your end. If you want the preview to display in VS Code, you'll need to install an extension. I use [bierner.markdown-mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) but there's a ton of them available.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Spell Out Rules & Guidelines\n\nReference your `README.md` or `.github/custom-instructions.md` file when defining strict guidelines, especially if a commit hook or linter is involved.\n\nIn your prompt, try adding something similar to:\n```text\nFollow conventions in README.md: Javadoc, pass all tests, adhere to secure coding guidelines.\n```\n\nFor narrow tasks, add file-specific context:\n```text\nImplement within #MyComponent.tsx, preserve API interface.\n```\n\n> 🏹 **One prompt → one premium request** in Agent Mode. Maximize your premium usage by combining as much information and context into a single prompt as possible.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Choose the Right AI Model\n\nThe model you choose is probably the next biggest impact to the overall implementation and outcome. When in doubt, try the cheapest one first (aka smallest premium multiplier). If it doesn't work the first time, `/clear` everything and then re-submit the prompt.\n\n|Task|Recommended Model|Alternate Model|\n|---|---|---|\n|New feature or complex logic|Claude Sonnet (any version)|Claude Opus|\n|Quick fix|o3/4-mini|Gemini 2.0 Flash|\n|Heavy analysis or debugging|o3/4 (regular)|Gemini 2.5 Pro|\n|Ideation or creative exploration|GPT-4.1|GPT-4.5|\n\n> 📌 Refer to [GitHub's model cheatsheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task) for more detailed info about picking the right model.\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: The VS Code Chat extension works like your terminal - just press the up arrow key to rotate through previous chats, even after you've cleared them. You can also use the history button at the top to return to a previously cleared chat.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Require a Self-Review Pass\n\nEither in the overall initial prompt or in a custom-instructions file, instruct GitHub Copilot to complete a detailed self-review of all changes made according to a set guideline (security, optimization, maintainability, etc):\n\n```text\n- Pass all tests & coverage checks\n- Meet lint & format requirements\n- Perform a detailed self-review with a focus on secure coding practices\n```\n> 💡 **ProTip**: You'll save on premium requests if you include the self-review requirements in the initial prompt. However, you'll get better results if you separate the review step from the implementation (be sure to `/clear` and consider changing the model, too!)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Supervise Your AI Pair\n\nAlways follow these basic guidelines whenever you're working with GitHub Copilot:\n\n1. **Never leave Copilot unattended** (ask me how I know :rofl:)\n    > :point_up: Asked and answered [here](https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh).\n\n1. When in doubt, pause the task\n1. Clarify & redirect whenever needed \n1. Resume only when context is clear\n1. Communicate manual edits with Copilot (else they'll get overwritten)\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: It doesn't seem to cost anything extra to simply pause execution, assess, and then resume. However, if you end up sending a new prompt to redirect they will charge you the standard premium request fee (whenever I figure out what that really means, I'll let you know!)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Review Like a Human\n\nUse VS Code’s diff view to accept/reset line-by-line. Keep changes by default and reset unwanted bits in Source Control - this helps prevent accidental resets.\n\nPick your battles. Don’t spend premium requests on minor formatting or nitpicks. Sometimes you have to accept that it's never going to be 100% perfect. Don't be afraid to jump in and take over when you need to.\n\n> 🚨 Channel your inner code review boss, every single time. Whether AI helped out or not, you’re always on the hook for clean, accurate code. Double-check, polish, and take pride in your commits - it’s your name on the line, so make sure it’s something you’d want to sign off on!\n\n---\n\n## 10. Refine, Reprompt & Repeat\n\nTreat every interaction with Copilot like you're teaching a junior dev. Use every available opportunity to improve your instructions, prompt, or clarify your goal:\n\n- Ask clarifying questions\n- Get alternate solutions\n- Propose different approaches (then let Copilot pick)\n- Prompt Copilot to challenge logic\n- Flag missing tests/docs with inline or PR comments\n\n> 💡 **ProTip**: Copilot is a powerful teammate, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution - especially when you’re dealing with brand-new repos, high-stakes production fires, or anything that needed to be done yesterday. Save yourself a headache: choose your AI battles wisely, and don’t try to make AI your Swiss Army knife for every situation. Sometimes, the fastest route is a good old-fashioned human touch.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Your Turn: \n\nWhat worked (or spectacularly failed)?

Copilot’s version: “you code it, you’re on the hook.” No late-night support call will blame the AI. The only fee you’ll pay is in lost sleep and an overage of Slack messages.\n\nIf you sneak in a “five-minute fix” without tests, it *will* bite back - and guess whose name is at the top of `git blame`?\n\n> 🙏 Don’t be that person whose only excuse is, “Copilot said it was fine!” That’s not the new “it was like that when I got here” - don’t let it start.\n\n---\n\n## 👀 Now What? AI Out Loud\n\nWondering what all this RAI talk means for you in the real world? Here’s the deal: any time AI helps out - own it, label it, and make sure everyone else can see it too. Transparency is the new black.\n\n### For Generated Reports & Docs\n\nIf Copilot whipped up your report (and it’s not code), just tack on a quick footer. Seriously - a copy, a paste, and you’re done. Want to automate it? Set up a user instruction and let Copilot add the credit line for you:\n\n```\n---\n\nGenerated with the help of GitHub Copilot, as directed by [YOUR NAME]\n```\n\n> 🕰️ If you want a timestamp, copy it in yourself. Trusting Copilot with dates is like asking your dog to set your alarm - cute, but you’re gonna be late.\n\n---\n\n### 🏷️ For Commits\n\n#### Step One: Embrace Conventional Commits\n\n> 🪦 Confession: I used to be the world’s **worst committer**! think “welp, THAT didn’t work” as a real commit message. And yes, it happened more than once...\n\nEventually, I went on a mission to find a clear, repeatable way to flag my AI-assisted commits. The answer? [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) (plus a linter for good measure). \n\nNever seen one? Here’s what it looks like:\n\n```\nfeat(api): [JIRA-123] Add api for xyz\n\n[optional bulleted list of changes]\n\n[footers - where the magic happens]\n```\n\n> 🦄 **Bonus:** You get automated changelogs for just a _little_ extra setup! Honestly, that’s what finally convinced me to use them every single time - no turning back.\n\n> 🪧 There are plenty of tools out there to help, too! Everything from classic git templates to handy CLI fill-in-the-blanks.\n\n---\n\n#### Step Two: My DIY Commit Disclosure Guide\n\nSince there's no true standard for this (at least, not yet), I want to share my (no-royalties-required) system for full commit-styled AI disclosure. \n\nIn every single commit, I add 2 separate footers: one stating exactly how Copilot was involved (cause it _always_ does something) and one is my \"signature\" that I reviewed, tested, and approved the implementation. \n\nIf Copilot played multiple roles? Keep it simple - go with the footer that best matches the most AI hands-on contribution.\n\n- If Copilot only wrote the commit message:\n\n    ```\n      Commit-generated-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>\n    ```\n<br/>\n- If I paired with Copilot (clear prompt and step-by-step direction):\n\n    ```\n    Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>\n    ```\n<br/>\n- If Copilot wrote most of the code (here, go implement this story):\n\n      ```\n      Generated-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>\n      ```\n<br/>\n- Always:\n\n      ```\n      Signed-off-by: Ashley Childress <1234-no-reply@github.com>\n      ``` \n    <br/>\n    > (or your name - unless you really want to blame me 😆)\n\nSo at 3am, when Future You (or some poor teammate) `git blame`s a file, you’ll know who did what. There's really no official standard yet, so go wild - or just slap a robot emoji 🤖 in there and call it done. **Just make it clear and take credit (or blame).**\n\n---\n\n## 🚫 Top 3 “Copilot, Stay in Your Lane!” Moments\n\nWhen I was little, my Granny would always say, “Sometimes, you’ve just got to wear your big girl panties.” Translation: there are times when you have to face the music and just deal with what’s in front of you - no shortcuts. If you let Copilot trash production... well, those are the only pants you’re getting.\n\n1. **Copilot is a tool, not a magician.** It’s been *confidently wrong* enough times to make me seriously question reality.\n    \n    > Me: “Where’s that logic _actually_ coded?\" \n    > Copilot: \\*conjuring code like a magician’s neverending handkerchief\\*\n    > Me: “You’ve got to be kidding me...”\n2. **You’re the adult in the room.** You have to know not just what Copilot *can* do, but also what it *can't* (or *shouldn't*).\n3. **Don't be afraid to bench Copilot.** Real debugging is sometimes just you, four friends, and a bunch of “what if...” ideas. AI’s not built for that kind of chaos. 🫠\n\n---\n\n## 🥊 Avoid Git Blame Drama\n\n- **Start with a plan** - don’t just wing it.\n- **Try prompting Copilot with TDD**, but know its tests can be as shallow as a kiddie pool if you don't provide the right context and criteria.\n- **Never accept code you don’t understand** - have Copilot ELI5 every step until you do.\n- **When it matters, write your own tests (or code)**. Copilot sometimes invents magical shortcuts - don’t follow the Keebler Elves into the tree!\n- **Disclose everything!** Tag Copilot’s work in your commit messages, READMEs, or reports. Future You will thank you.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Your turn!\n\nHave a Copilot win, a fail, or an epic facepalm moment? Drop it in the comments - bonus points for memes, hot takes, or your best \"AI tried, I survived\" story. Let’s make RAI actually fun (or at least not completely boring)! ✨\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ AI Helped, I’m Still to Blame\nThis post was brewed by me - with a shot of ChatGPT, a splash of sarcasm, and zero disclaimers skipped. If you catch bias or a goof, call it out. AI isn’t perfect (neither am I).\n\n",
