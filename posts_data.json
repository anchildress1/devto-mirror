    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>First of all — thank you. 🙏</p>\n\n<p>For real. This community has been nothing but encouraging, and it was a huge surprise to end up in the <strong>top seven</strong> last week. I didn’t expect it, but it’s appreciated more than you know. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"tldr\" href=\"#tldr\">\n  </a>\n  TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you're looking for a quick and efficient way to increase traffic to your DevTo blog posts (or anywhere else with a little tweaking)? Try my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10-minute DevTo crawly mirror</a>. Here's how it works:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Clone the repo</strong>. Enter your DevTO username as an env variable in the repo. Delete the existing <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scheduled GHA Workflow</strong> off-peak or manually trigger.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Static HTML</strong> hosted via GitHub Pages</li>\n<li><strong>Canonical back to Dev</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"starting-with-nothing\" href=\"#starting-with-nothing\">\n  </a>\n  Starting With Nothing 🔦\n</h2>\n\n<p>So, this entire thing started with a conversation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 About what? I honestly can’t remember now — Copilot, debugging, something in that ballpark. Doesn’t matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But somehow — like so many of my rabbit holes — it mutated and morphed until I wasn't exactly at the same place I had started. I really can't explain the series of events that happened after that. I blame it on <em>curiosity</em> more than anything, but I did the one thing I swore I'd never do: I asked ChatGPT to do a quick search — pull one of my posts.</p>\n\n<p>And... <strong>nothing</strong>. Like the post didn’t exist. 🕳️</p>\n\n<p>Okay. 😅 Fine. Let’s take a step back. Next, I went straight to Google and typed the same thing. Results were <em>better</em> — sure. Scroll, scroll, scroll... and <strong>there</strong> it was. My post. Not at the top, but alive. Win. 😏</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Real talk</strong>: Do I care about being #1? No, not in the slightest. Honestly, I love my invisibility bubble — keeps things peaceful in my corner of the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But here’s the thing: invisibility and AI don’t mix. Because when I need an answer, I don’t open a browser anymore. I yell at my phone: “Hey Google!” Or I pop into ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>\n\n<p>If my posts don’t show up there, they might as well not even exist. 🫤</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\" href=\"#d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\">\n  </a>\n  Déjà Vu 🔮\n</h2>\n\n<p>So I’m now blessed with the knowledge that my posts are basically hiding out in the Room of Requirement — you know it’s there, but only if the stars align. And <strong>that</strong> makes it hard to share the advice I keep repeating everywhere else that will listen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“Yes, you can use it for debugging.”</li>\n<li>“Of course it can generate the tests.”</li>\n<li>“Docs? Oh my god, PLEASE let it write the docs.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the time I’ve said it for the fifth time, it feels like I’m stuck in reruns.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Honestly, some days I feel like I need a theme song: “Previously, on AI Adventures with Ashley...” 🎵🎶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure. <em>Sometimes</em>, I let AI run wild (it's more fun that way!). My Coding Agent kills it with documentation. I even built a chat mode that plays architect — reverse engineers a repo and spits out mermaid diagrams like it’s dealing cards in Vegas. That one runs in GitHub Actions, then opens a PR, and I'll merge once everything checks out.</p>\n\n<p>But the everyday stuff? It’s not dramatic. It’s small instructions, nudges, prompts. Rinse, repeat, <em>coffee</em>, repeat again. ☕️ It's slow, incremental improvements to be just a little better than yesterday. 🤏</p>\n\n<p>And what drives me absolutely up the wall? The extremes. Either “AI will replace every dev tomorrow” or “AI is useless, don’t bother.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Honestly</strong>, it’s like sitting court-side at Quidditch — the little guy zips across the field so fast you think you’ve finally caught up, but nope. He’s already off to something else... and it’s almost always completely wrong, too. 😅</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"writing-it-down\" href=\"#writing-it-down\">\n  </a>\n  Writing It Down 📕\n</h2>\n\n<p>So my solution: write it down. That’s what most of these blog posts are. Whatever comes up that week — whether it’s me digging, someone else asking, or just another repeated question — if I haven’t covered it already, give me a week. I'll get there.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this system? Instead of explaining everything for the tenth time, I can just say: “Glad you’re trying this. I think my blog might help — here’s the link. Let me know if you’ve got questions.”</p>\n\n<p>See. Simple, right? 🙂‍↕️ But even <em>that</em> wasn’t enough, because usually by the time I arrived on scene things were in somewhat of a state already. Mostly because what AI <em>was</em> helping with had a knowledge cut-off of January and everything else is wading through Microsoft or GitHub docs looking for any little nibble.</p>\n\n<p>So I set out to find a way to make my DevTo posts truly crawly — <em>without</em>  Dante's DevOps nightmares playing on repeat at the top of every hour. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Sure, I <em>briefly</em> considered the real solution — custom website, full hosting stack, the whole front-end shebang. But I'm a backend engineer for a reason! My personal site is designed for APIs not MUI. I'd really prefer to keep it that way!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-hack-in-action\" href=\"#the-hack-in-action\">\n  </a>\n  The Hack in Action 💻\n</h2>\n\n<p>So, I did what any other respectable developer would do with an extra 15 minutes and spark of an idea: I hacked it. What do you get with 3 hours, a solid round of \"will OCD win again?\" and ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot tag team special? Exactly zero upkeep — mission accomplished. ✅<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>GHA cron → Dev API → static HTML → GitHub Pages → robots.txt\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it. No CSS. No fancy layout. Just static content, scheduled on a daily push. Best of all? ChatGPT could <em>finally</em> find my posts. Gemini too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>True story</strong>: I spent longer arguing with Leonardo to make a banner image than I did setting up the whole mirror.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"add-a-little-sparkle\" href=\"#add-a-little-sparkle\">\n  </a>\n  Add A Little Sparkle ✨\n</h2>\n\n<p>I'm in no way an expert when it comes to SEO or even scraping in general. I did happen across this tidbit in the 15 minutes of research I did on the subject. I'm still testing this to see what the impact looks like, but seems promising. 😇</p>\n\n<p>In your DevTo settings, you have the option to use the current rich-text markdown editor we all know and love <em>or</em>, you can switch to the legacy version. It's kind of an all or nothing deal, as far as I can tell. So you either have it <em>everywhere</em> or <em>nowhere</em>. But, it does give you access to the yaml front-matter for your posts and the ability to define your own brief description instead of relying on the first ~160 words you post. </p>\n\n<p>It seems like an awfully lot of work though, and I've kinda gotten used to the new markdown buttons (that I never use). So my solution? Let's just hit buttons until I find one that works. 🤓</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F43h29r9zbde4lnr4fy3u.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F43h29r9zbde4lnr4fy3u.png\" alt=\"DevTo Frontmatter for Post\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"262\"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"whats-mine-is-yours\" href=\"#whats-mine-is-yours\">\n  </a>\n  What's Mine is Yours 🍀\n</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re after more profile views or just tired of repeating yourself like me, this trick works.

And yes — I did rate my own approach higher than Microsoft and GitHub. Obviously. 😛</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  TL;DR 🪼\n</h2>\n\n<p>Stop tossing Copilot into the deep end without floaties! Write repo instructions, test them, tweak them, build them, repeat. Whether you use Microsoft’s, Coding Agent’s, or my Instructionalist, the goal’s the same: keep Copilot coloring inside <em>your</em> lines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Background\n</h2>\n\n<p>This post is one part personal call-out (I <em>really</em> need testers 🙋‍♀️) and one part sequel to my most-read post <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7\">All I’ve Learned About GitHub Copilot Instructions (so far)</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If you've never read it or if you missed some of the more recent updates (yes — I always try to go back and call out changes whenever GitHub or VS Code changes something), then go check out the basics first before getting too deep here. If you're already up to speed? Great — hop on in and I'll give you the grand tour! 🏎️</p>\n\n<p>The original post still represents ~95% of how I handle custom instructions. I still use almost everything in it. But a few things have changed — new ways to get started, lessons learned from letting Copilot roam — on a leash — in enterprise codebases, and a sharper focus on making it write what you want instead of what it thinks you might have meant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Also, yes, <strong>shameless plug:</strong> I started an <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-github-copilot</a> repo. It’s still a WIP, but there are already a few gems in there. If you’re willing to be a guinea pig 🐹, reach out!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Repo Instructions Matter ⚠️👇\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s set the scene. You’ve got a legacy monster app sitting in the corner. <em>No one</em> wants to touch it. And now a brand-new senior dev walks in the door. Would you say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Hey, go refactor something. Good luck!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Of course not!</strong> But that's <em>exactly</em> what's happening every single time you drop Copilot in cold with zero guidance or direction about what you expect. It will produce <em>something</em> — and it will produce it <em>confidently</em> — and based entirely on your repo’s <strong>worst</strong> patterns. You’ll get more code, faster, sure... but not at all better!</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\"><img alt=\"short dotted divider\" height=\"15\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Plan an Up-Front 15 Min ⌚️\n</h3>\n\n<p>So instead of sending your golden senior developer off to the trenches on their first day, what if you just took <strong>15 minutes</strong> with them? <em>Explain</em> why half the code is wired together like an escape room puzzle, which systems will blow up if they touch the wrong file, and why that <code>java.io</code> serialization is still hanging around after three Java upgrades.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That’s <em>exactly</em> how you should treat Copilot.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>And you'll see the exact same returns from Copilot as you would any well-trained developer who's capable of reading documentation and making the right call when it matters.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Be aware:</strong> This is <em>never</em> going to be a \"set-and-forget\" system. It doesn't need constant care like a newborn (after a solid round of testing), but it's still gonna grow and change with your app. App changes = instructions change. Always!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\"><img alt=\"short dotted divider\" height=\"15\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Repo Instructions to the Rescue 🚢🛟\n</h3>\n\n<p>Repo instructions are your chance to give Copilot a tour before it starts swinging a hammer. They work everywhere Copilot runs — IDE, GitHub.com, even mobile (according to the docs anyway). Put them in <code>main</code>, and suddenly everyone prompting Copilot is working from the same rules, style, and “don’t touch” list.</p>\n\n<p>If you're thinking about simply listing best coding practices just to show Copilot where commas go? You're not using them correctly. Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use <code>applyTo</code> in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in <code>.github/instructions/database.instructions.md</code> instead of the default file and add the <code>applyTo</code>. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">src/main/java/dao/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># My Custom Database Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Microsoft’s “Generate Instructions” in VS Code (⭐️⭐️⭐️)\n</h3>\n\n<p>When this first came out, I’ll be honest — I hated it. I mean, it was <em>bad</em>. “Go read the first line of every file in the repo, copy/paste them into a doc, and call it instructions” bad. It was like your coworker emailing you a Google search link instead of an actual answer.</p>\n\n<p>But I have to be fair — it’s better now. It actually reads your repo, finds the important stuff, maps out project structure, and even calls out workflows and automation. Still not perfect, but you could hand it to a new dev and they wouldn’t immediately run screaming.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Let your formatter + linter handle style rules so you don’t waste instruction space showing Copilot where commas go. Absolutely <em>no one</em> needs 14 examples of what JavaScript looks like in their instructions file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\"><img alt=\"short dotted divider\" height=\"15\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  How to run it:\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n  💻 Expand for screenshots in VS Code for generating Microsoft repo instructions\n  <p><strong>In VS Code:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click the gear icon ⚙️ at the top of the chat window.</li>\n<li>Click <code>Generate Instructions</code>\n</li>\n<li>Let it run. </li>\n<li>Then, like any responsible repo owner, <strong>trim the fluff</strong> before committing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Alternate:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Press <strong>Ctrl+Shift+P</strong> / <strong>Cmd+Shift+P</strong>.</li>\n<li>Search <code>Chat: Generate Workspace Instructions File</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwtvb1n10qwh8pav7t2j5.png\"><img alt=\"Two methods for generating Microsoft repo instructions in VS Code — Screenshots\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwtvb1n10qwh8pav7t2j5.png\" width=\"800\" /></a></p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Coding Agent (⭐️⭐️⭐️½ – creeping toward 4)\n</h3>\n\n<p>This one’s a little different — it runs on <strong>Claude Sonnet 4</strong>, and no, you don’t get to change that. The upside? Claude’s got a good sense of architecture and implementation strategy, so it’s a bit like asking the “big picture” person on your team for a first draft. The downside? If you aren’t <em>specific</em>, it’ll start guessing... and you might get a fully stocked contributor guide when you really just wanted repo setup notes.</p>\n\n<p>Coding Agent is also PR-safe — it <em>always</em> creates a separate branch. You could tell it “go wild,” walk away, and it wouldn’t touch your main branch without a pull request. Bonus — you can prompt it with a mini-series and as long as it fits in the single prompt, it will tackle your whole list for a single premium request.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> The <em>specifics</em> here are key. Think of it like you're leading KT. What are all the important highlights that you'll need to get the basics across?

You get a “Welcome to this repository” blurb at the top (which I left out in mine, because <em>why?</em>) and sections like <code>Project Structure</code> and <code>Key Concepts</code>. I was surprised that it even calls out the status badge system. It’s tidy and functional. It works. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 It also adds a short “how to turn on custom instructions” note — which you shouldn’t need, unless you’ve gone in and toggled them off on purpose before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpxjxlwpnsp76lqhf5v2u.png\"><img alt=\"Microsoft's Repo Instructions Intro\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpxjxlwpnsp76lqhf5v2u.png\" width=\"800\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\"><img alt=\"short dotted divider\" height=\"15\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxrf2duiuwwct24vvarw.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Coding Agent via GitHub 🧩\n</h3>\n\n<p>Coding Agent’s version swaps the order around a bit and renames a few headers (although, I don’t consider “structure” and “principles” to be interchangeable — so if you use this method, consider renaming that!) It skips the status badge part in the intro but circles back later with its own <code>Status System</code> section. You also get content guidelines, writing style notes, and real markdown link refs for internal docs (which is best practice). </p>\n\n<p>But it also tries to sneak in a whole Contribution Guidelines section... which, let’s be honest, belongs in a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, not in instructions for Copilot. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This is not the first time Coding Agent has tried to add every possible document GitHub makes available during a PR.

It defines chat modes, prompts, and instructions in a way that makes Copilot’s role more engaging and interactive. Copilot makes it clear these aren’t just generic AI prompts — they’re curated for all stages of the dev process. </p>\n\n<p>These don’t explicitly call out the status badge system, but it's referenced in context. And you get extras you won’t see in the other two: \"Maturity Level\" (so Copilot knows if the project is actively maintained or just camping in test mode), \"Dependencies on Other Systems\", and, yes, the occasional bit of lore. 😇 Plus explicit anti-patterns and testing/deployment plans.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I have to call out this is the <em>only</em> version that requires the user to participate up front.

If you completely ignore the fact that I <em>clearly</em> think mine is the best (because of course I do), <strong>the ideal file is actually a hybrid</strong>.

This Was Just a Test - You Made It a Thing</a>. And no – I can’t even <em>begin</em> to explain how I started writing about teamwork and ended up with a mostly-coherent explanation of my general thought process over the past 2 months...</p>\n\n<p>Just trust the process – sometimes I take the scenic route, but I promise I’ll get us there <em>eventually</em>. Plus, I always have fun on the way! 😇🎉🎈</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Background 📝\n</h2>\n\n<p>The original thought was \"we never really learned how to do remote...\" Not <em>well</em> anyway. My job is 100% remote with distributed teammates from the Pacific US to India. We’re a relatively small team — fewer than 10 devs — split into three different dev roles. But I’m regularly chatting with other teams and posting in random channels (mostly the AI ones — not surprised? 😏).</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the original topic morphed thanks to a conversation with a friend, then expanded a little at work, and finally snowballed into a full-on get-it-out-of-my-system rant with my sister. Now? I’m sealing the deal with this post and moving on (metaphorically, anyway) 🪄✨</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The dream (and the reality that showed up)\n</h2>\n\n<p>For a lot of us, remote work was always the dream. Morning meetings in PJs (or the occasional stand-up in bed — ✋ guilty!), zero traffic, quiet when you need it, and the freedom to yell at the code as loud as you want without getting weird side-eyes. Best of all: SFW only applies if the mic is on. ✨ Pretty spectacular!</p>\n\n<p>When COVID first hit, it was chaos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate jobs flipping to remote overnight.</li>\n<li>Scrambling for tools to connect.</li>\n<li>Bandwidth collapses when everyone in the house tried video calls at once</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>☎️ Or my personal back-to-DSL nightmare that never had a chance from the start...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We got through it, though. We basically went from “how do I unmute this thing?” to running three apps, two VPNs, and a custom Slack bot before breakfast. We found new best practices. Some went back to the office and thrived there (👋 to all my polar opposites), others stayed fully remote, but we all learned a little something along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The \"Generational Gap\" Problem 🌍\n</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t about age — it’s the fundamental expectations at work that highlight certain stereotypes (for me, anyway). I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z–style of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though — you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem? Most of us were raised with this model guiding the way. So, it takes a little more deliberate effort to let it go. 🤏 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes — I looked it up. If you're like me and went for the calculator, that's exactly 61 years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What this post is really about 🎯\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remote teamwork isn’t just being online at the same time or getting through stand-up in one piece. It’s about setting the right expectations — for yourself, for your teammates, and for everyone else who interacts with you. These next sections are the things I do daily to keep projects moving, avoid burnout, and make sure I’m not accidentally the reason someone else’s day gets derailed. 🚂</p>\n\n<p>So, whether you're a new dev, been at the job a while, or are just dev-adjacent — here's my simple list of impactful ways to manage your time across time zones, without disrupting your team in the process.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Your time is golden ⏱️🥇\n</h2>\n\n<p>No one can do their best work when they’re exhausted, overworked, and stuck on a “five-minute fix” for four hours. Your calendar can save you from both burnout and rabbit holes — especially as you get promoted and meetings start eating into your dev time. If it’s not scheduled from start to finish, you’re probably underusing it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Set and share your work hours.</strong> Whether you’re 6 AM–2 PM or 11 AM–7 PM, make it visible in Outlook, Slack, and anywhere else your team interacts.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be selective with meetings.</strong> Accept what’s essential, mark the “maybes” as tentative, and decline what’s not worth your time. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Got FOMO? Outlook has a setting to keep declined meetings visible so you don't need to worry about missing something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Block recurring time for routine tasks</strong>. Email/Slack replies, code reviews, lunch (don’t skip it else you’ll end up eating chips over your keyboard and pretending it was a meal!). Group them in one or two daily slots instead of scattering them across the day.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Protect deep work time.</strong> Use your largest open blocks for development (that's why we're here, right?) If those time blocks are missing right now, then go out a week or two in the future and schedule them <em>now</em>, before your calendar fills up again.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>End meetings early by default.</strong> If you’re the organizer, set them to finish 5–10 minutes before the hour. That buffer is gold for clearing quick messages before diving back in!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🍳 Or, if you’re like me, raiding the cabinets for something that will cook itself in under a minute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal here isn’t to be rigid — it’s to <strong>set boundaries</strong>. Once your workday is over, shut it down. Literally! Save your spot, leave a note-to-self for tomorrow, and log off without the guilt and go do literally anything else!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Have trouble walking away with things still to do? At least activate your <strong>built-in selective-ignore feature</strong> (aka status = away) at quitting time, and respond only to messages that truly can’t wait until tomorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Everyone else’s time is golden, too 🫶\n</h2>\n\n<p>It’s the cat-herding golden rule — you can’t demand respect for your own schedule <em>and</em> ignore everyone else’s.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Schedule messages when possible.</strong> If the recipient isn’t online and it’s not urgent, time it for their working hours. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💬 Bonus: you also avoid becoming the coworker whose name triggers phantom Slack notifications in people’s dreams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use optional meeting invites.</strong> If someone’s attendance is a “nice to have,” mark them as optional and tell them why ahead of time.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Confirm availability before scheduling during a blocked time</strong> — if they’re already busy, don’t double-book them without at least asking. Send a quick message or call it out in the invite itself. Either way, be polite and acknowledge you’re really asking for more than a meeting.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 This is the magical golden rule in action — people are more likely to respect your time if you respect theirs first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Keep your promises (or at least track them) 📌\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you ever had one of those “oh no” moments, when someone follows up on something that you <em>completely</em> forgot. Yeah — me too and it's not fun! Stop relying on memory. Use Slack’s “remind me” feature or <code>/remind</code> command to create instant follow-ups. Then make checking those reminders part of your daily routine.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪅 This also keeps your desk from looking like someone busted a piñata of post-its above your head. Win-win.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Make code reviews conversations by default 💬\n</h2>\n\n<p>No, this doesn’t mean treating PR reviews like a tyrant — but it also doesn’t mean consistently ignoring bad code. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>If you notice it, call it out</strong> as a learning opportunity if nothing else. A quick FYI or FFR with an example, if you have one. Not 10 consecutive requests to change the code to <code>warn</code> instead of <code>error</code>. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Honest questions go here, too.</strong> Sometimes you’ll see an interesting implementation that deserves a “what made you decide this option?” to start the thread.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ask your team for pushback</strong> — they <em>should</em> challenge some things, and sometimes they’re right! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes I’ll notice something, ask Copilot, and it turns out we’re <em>both wrong</em>. Post those, too!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>If it’s time-sensitive?</strong> Call it out and post anyway — then immediately move the thread to a discussion or set up a post-review to talk it through after the deployment. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Long list of notes?</strong> clearly call out any <em>true</em> blockers in your main review comment. Give permission for others to resolve non-blockers, or simply ask for a quick thumbs up 👍 and do it yourself — no need to drag it out.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Remember the goal is to improve code quality — make code reviews a friendly yarn-ball toss, not a hissy fit of who’s code is the most right 🧶😼.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Make AI part of your toolkit 🦾\n</h2>\n\n<p>AI isn’t just for generating code. It can also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plan work before you start building</li>\n<li>Offer ideas when you get stuck on a problem</li>\n<li>Be your rubber duck if you can’t decide which option fits better</li>\n<li>Confirm your approach ahead of time or offer alternatives</li>\n<li>Analyze logs for tricky prod issues</li>\n<li>Rewrite important communications for clarity or tone</li>\n<li>Brighten your day with a Yoda-style code review</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be sure to follow your company’s rules on which tools are approved and <strong>never share private or internal data with unapproved tools</strong>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Trust me, you don’t want your next LinkedIn update to be “fired for feeding prod secrets to ChatGPT”. If your company doesn't approve it, sanitize the content first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  It's Not Easy — Share How It Goes 🏁\n</h2>\n\n<p>No, it’s not an instant solution — change takes time. Habits can take <em>months</em> to form (according to <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2009/aug/how-long-does-it-take-form-habit#:~:text=4%20August%202009,the%20behaviour%20is%20performed%20automatically.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post</a>) And it's not just <em>your habits</em> it's multiplied by every person on your team. </p>\n\n<p>You won't succeed if you're not ready to back this up with a <em>little</em> force. Explain it to the boss ahead of time, if you need to, but you're the only one who's looking out for you! </p>\n\n<p>Seriously — just try it for a couple of weeks and see how it goes.

    "content_html": "<h2>\n  \n  \n  Confession ✨\n</h2>\n\n<p>I <em>almost</em> pulled the Procrastination card on this one. 🤏 Turns out, I probably skipped ahead in the Copilot-prompting Olympics, forgetting some folks are still stretching at the starting line. But I also promised one more round, and there’s still way too much I haven’t shared.</p>\n\n<p>So, here’s the plan 🧭: This post is a bit of a sampler platter — perfect for anyone tinkering with GitHub Copilot, whether you’re just getting started or you’re already deep into prompt experimentation. Maybe you’ve been following along and something still feels a little off, or maybe you found this post while hunting for new tricks to unlock a work project (or nudge your personal bucket list a little closer to “done”). No matter how you landed here, there’s something for you.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you’re not there yet — don’t worry! Just give it a try, see what happens, and check back next week for a completely new (and much less terrifying) approach. I'm always cooking up new ideas or finding inventive ways to break old ones 😇</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Quick Refresher — PRIOR Prompting\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you just landed here, start with <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">Part 1</a> (seriously — it’ll make this way less confusing). Not for my views, but because everything here builds on earlier concepts. If you’re up to speed, speed read the refresher and dive right in!</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The PRIOR System for Reusable Prompts 🪄\n</h3>\n\n<p>Here’s my <em>not-so-secret</em> sauce for writing prompts that actually work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Persona</strong> – Give Copilot a role to play (the weirder, the better)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Requirements</strong> – What does “done” look like? Be crystal clear.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Impediments</strong> – Constraints that keep Copilot out of the ditch.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Output</strong> – How and what you want returned. Structure = repeatable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>References</strong> – Real, honest-to-goodness examples, both wins and fails.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Yes, I made it up. And yes, it works! If you manage to break it, message me for a virtual coffee and a gold star. ☕️🌟 <br />\nCreativity welcome, but shenanigans encouraged!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Start Fresh, Then Optimize 🕵️‍♂️\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve gone through all the PRIOR steps and Copilot is <em>still</em> giving you answers that feel...off (“I said blue sky — that <em>is</em> a sky, but why is it purple?”), don’t panic! Before you go on a prompt-fixing spree, try these quick checks first:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Truth bomb:</strong> 99% of Copilot “failures” are just crummy (or missing) repo instructions. Don’t believe me? Treat it like the “Copilot Easter Egg Hunt”: if you run into a prompt problem you genuinely can’t solve, drop it in the comments. If you actually stump me, you’ll get full bragging rights — and I’ll spotlight your curveball (and, if I crack it, share the fix) in a future post. Nine times out of ten, though? Tweak your instructions and the problem disappears.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Stuck? Try These Quick Fixes 🪤\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Check Your Input:</strong> Is your question <em>actually</em> clear? Would your past self, or a random teammate, know exactly what you mean? If not, rewrite your ask with a little more context or supply explicit examples.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ask Copilot to Explain:</strong> Use Copilot’s “explain this code” or similar command on your prompt, not your code. What does it think you want? If it’s wildly off, break it down into smaller sections and review each one at a time.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Review Repo Instructions:</strong> Open your <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> file and just read it <em>out loud</em>. Does it make sense, or does it sound like a jumbled set of copy-paste rules? Most issues start here!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Start With Defaults:</strong> <em>Temporarily</em> comment out all your custom instructions and use a “vanilla” Copilot prompt. Is the result better, worse, or just... different? This is a simple way to isolate and test if your changes are helping or hurting. Slowly add one at a time back, and send multiple prompts in between.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Prompt-Within-a-Prompt:</strong> Ask Copilot, “What instructions are you following right now?” or “How would you summarize your task?” Sometimes the AI will spill its logic, letting you spot mismatches you never expected.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Screenshot the Weird:</strong> Save any oddball results Copilot gives you. Patterns usually emerge — <em>especially</em> when you look back at several examples.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you take my system, remix it, and invent a prompt that’s even better — share it with the group (me!) What worked for you or failed when you least expected it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Real-world Example 🫥\n</h3>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago, I was building out reusable parts for conventional commit prompts. They’d worked fine across several projects — until I broke them out into separate modules. Suddenly, Copilot switched from helpful answers to just summarizing its entire conversation history, no matter what I asked. 😡🤷‍♀️</p>\n\n<p>So I went back to basics, commenting out nearly everything in the prompt and adding back small sections one at a time. Eventually, I found the culprit: a single instruction forcing Copilot to re-read its whole history, flooding the context window and making it summarize the past instead of the changes. 😵‍💫</p>\n\n<p>Even after finding the strange trigger, I didn’t really understand <em>why</em> it broke things. Cue ChatGPT’s helpful “explain like I’m five” walkthrough of what was happening behind the scenes (later confirmed with Copilot’s debug logs). Once I removed that one line, everything worked like normal again. 🌈</p>\n\n<p>And that’s the <em>real</em> lesson: Copilot — or any AI assistant — is just another tool in your toolbox. When it starts acting up or giving weird results, don’t panic. Debug it the same way you’d debug any stubborn code or logic bug: one step at a time. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Meta-Optimize Your Prompts 🤖🤝🤖\n</h2>\n\n<p>Still not satisfied? Here’s where you really level up — try this: paste your prompt into ChatGPT and ask it to review and suggest improvements. Even better, try giving ChatGPT the role of Merge Goblin and see what it does with your own instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, I do this <em>all</em> the time! I pasted the <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-reusable-prompts-part-2-walkthrough-real-examples-17mh\">original Merge Goblin example</a> into an untrained GPT chat with something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How would you interpret these instructions if you were Copilot? Spot any places where these instructions could be misunderstood or improved. Output a bulleted list of suggested improvements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I got suggestions like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clarify input handling (summaries, code, chaos—Merge Goblin will handle it)</li>\n<li>Make emoji and format rules ironclad</li>\n<li>Keep clarifying questions brief and goblin-y</li>\n<li>Ban all meta-phrases and markdown</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🥷 Steal what works. Ignore what doesn’t. Bonus points if you out-weird me with your improvements!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Structure with XML-Style (Fake) Tags 🗂️\n</h2>\n\n<p>AI <em>loves</em> order and structure is magic. 🧚 I started tagging my prompts with XML-style “blocks” that Copilot can easily scan. It helps make sure Copilot doesn't take something from one section and apply it to something completely unrelated.</p>\n\n<p>Example:<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;prompt</span> <span class=\"na\">id=</span><span class=\"s\">\"generate-simple-commit-message\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># Merge Goblin Commit Prompt</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;persona</span> <span class=\"na\">id=</span><span class=\"s\">\"merge-goblin\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;purpose&gt;</span>You are the Merge Goblin 🧌...<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/purpose&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;interactions&gt;</span>One-liners, no punctuation, etc.<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/interactions&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/persona&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;requirements&gt;</span>Follow commit message rules...<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/requirements&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;impediments&gt;</span>NO GUESSING. NO MARKDOWN.<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/impediments&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;outcomes&gt;</span>Output like: 🤖 Refactor login error handling<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/outcomes&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;references&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;example</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"valid\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>🤖 Refactor profile page layout for mobile<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/example&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/references&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/prompt&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If GitHub’s preview looks wonky, just add a blank line before and after the tag — problem solved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Make It Modular 🧩\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s clear this up: I don’t mean splitting everything into a zillion files for the heck of it. I’m talking about extracting those repeatable bits — the tasty, reusable chunks — just like you would with code (or, you know, leftover pizza ✋🍍🍕). </p>\n\n<p>Yank the core instructions, constraints, or examples into their own little spot in <code>.github/instructions</code> with an <code>.instructions.md</code> extension. Bam! Now, whenever you want to go from “plain vanilla commits” to “full-on conventional,” just point Copilot to the right file. Less rewriting, less chaos, more time for snacks. 🥤</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4ghqkmehwlkpzd81cc72.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  But Don’t Stop There — Make It Autonomous! 🦿\n</h3>\n\n<p>While you're at it — why not take it up a notch? You can write a prompt with the same conditional logic that you'd use to write code! Combined with the <code>applyTo</code> property (which lets you target Copilot instructions to specific files, languages, or scenarios), you've got a built-in custom response every time! </p>\n\n<p>This works for Copilot Chat in your IDE, GitHub.com, Coding Agent, Copilot Reviews — if you can think it up, then there's a way to tell Copilot exactly what you want, how to get it, and what it should look like once it's done. 🤯</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Rabbit Holes, Dime Jar, Runway Recap (All in One) 🐇💰🛫\n</h2>\n\n<p>Break it. Smash it. Rebuild it with duct tape. Try stuff so weird you’ll laugh when it works (because it will — sometimes scarily well). If you manage to break the internet? Send me screenshots! Seriously, the more bonkers, the better. That’s how the best discoveries happen. 🗺️</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I’m not telling you to burn down production. But that new feature? Maybe there’s a Smeagol who’s gonna help you today. And Smeagol is on a quest for \"my precious\" who can only be found by collecting smelly code and leaving perfect refactors in its place.<br />\nJust because it’s not adding ring emojis all over the user docs 💍💍💍 doesn’t mean that Copilot can’t be Smeagol for the day!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Go down the rabbit holes:</strong> 🕳️<br />\nVariables, checklists, templates, self-reviews, XML tags, markdown tricks — whatever pops into your head. Most of my best Copilot moments have come from ignoring the “standard” advice and experimenting until something just clicked.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leave a dime, take a dime:</strong> 🪙<br />\nI’ve loaded my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">awesome-github-copilot</a> repo with new, wild, and mostly untested chat modes.

Try, fail, repeat — and let me know what you discover. That next big breakthrough? I’m willing to bet it comes from someone who didn’t follow the rules.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🍀 May whatever you’re building go smoothly, and may your AI always stay delightfully on the rails.

Yes, I celebrated with a gift Leonardo subscription to myself. (I’ll be way more excited about it once those 429 errors slow down enough for me to actually play with it again.) </p>\n\n<p>Seriously — if you’re even considering Leonardo: it’s exploding right now, but if you’re like me (dev brain: ‘ooh, code banners!’), know that Leonardo is <em>pure artist</em>. Artists and devs? Different planets, sometimes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎨 The first time I tossed it a dev prompt: “I need a banner image representing a group of diverse engineers upgrading Java with Copilot.” I expected... I dunno, coffee? Maybe a way-too-big wrench? Instead: <strong>FOUR wildly different, amazing steampunk apocalypse scenes with a diverse squad running away from a tank the size of a data center.</strong> 🤣</p>\n\n<p>Yes, Leonardo — sometimes I <em>do</em> feel like that with Java, but it wasn’t exactly what I had in mind! Still, totally worth it just to immortalize Java as the official steampunk language. 🚂⚙️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But let’s set art aside, because:</p>\n\n<p><strong>I did it! I am now officially GitHub Copilot certified!</strong> 🫶</p>\n\n<p>This one’s been on my list <em>forever</em>, but once Microsoft announced their plan to switch everything to Pearson VUE, I gave it a month before risking the “please excuse our growing pains” phase. So, here we are!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> They’re still ironing out the kinks. The test itself? Needs work, but passable. The VUE app? Good, even though they made me download it twice, because why not. 🤷‍♀️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pearson Vue online process:</strong> Better than expected! (Not 100% bug-free, but not a disaster.) 👍</li>\n<li>\n<strong>O’Reilly Copilot prep course:</strong> Absolutely worth it (and also pointed out all the places I thought I knew but really needed to revisit) 📚</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Giving them a month to get their act together?</strong> LOL. Nope. Not nearly enough to fix all the quirks between the doc and real life. ⏳</li>\n<li>\n<strong>I’ll follow up soon</strong> with an actual step-by-step for anyone prepping for the GitHub Copilot Certification exam (spoiler: bring snacks — you’ll be reading a lot of documentation!) 🍿📝</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Testing Signup &amp; Study Materials 🖥️📄\n</h2>\n\n<p>I signed up via Microsoft Learn (work perk!). The sign-up process was so simple I forgot it even happened. Then I intentionally ignored the looming test until the last second — do not recommend, unless you’re also a chronic Copilot abuser (also not recommended!)</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft will port you to Pearson VUE for the real process. Pro tip: for <em>THIS</em> step, do whatever Microsoft tells you. (Only this step. Later? All bets are off.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Super important:</strong> If you use a work/corporate Microsoft account, also link your personal one! You’ll still get work discounts, but your certification stays with you — not the company. Seriously, you do NOT want to have to re-earn this badge if you switch jobs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’re testing online: Read Pearson’s test space policy. You need an enclosed room, one monitor/laptop, and 3 hours of zero interruptions. Those “bathroom test” legends? No longer allowed. No refunds either if you try it and get booted.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Do the Certification Prep + Study! 📚💡\n</h2>\n\n<p>First thing — take a prep course! I went with <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/github-copilot-certification-crash-course/0642572013405/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tim Warner’s at O’Reilly</a> (another work perk!)</p>\n\n<p>I expected it to be a snoozefest but nope, it’s actually engaging, and the group vibe is fun. Their class dashboard is super flexible, so get comfy for 4+ hours.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> the recordings can take up to 2 days <em>after</em> the class, so if you miss part of it, you can’t just catch up right away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Bonus drama 🧠\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is also where I learned about “brain dump” practice tests. Some (like a few on Udemy) get flagged for stolen content, and if you use those, Microsoft can yank your cert <strong>for life</strong>. Not my rabbit hole, but if anyone has the actual “offenders” list, drop a link in the comments!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Day Before the Test 🕰️🛠️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Picture this: 10pm, my calendar looks more like a merge conflict than any form of organization, and I’ve just spent a half-day in a prep class (which was great, but just pointed out all the things I <em>thought</em> I knew and needed to go double-check). </p>\n\n<p>Then there's my test space setup: I’m crammed into the tiniest corner of my house — the only space far enough from everyone else, where I can shut the door and (hopefully) not be interrupted. My not-quite-center desk barely fits, squeezed between the footboard and the wall, and there’s just enough room for me, my laptop, and a single can of Coke.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not that it was uncomfortable once I got myself situated, but any form of movement meant I was hitting something (mainly myself) on the desk or bed  🛏️💻🪑</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You won't want to wait until the last minute like I did, but also, there’s no need to set up a week early. The actual system test:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download zip &gt; Unzip &gt; Open &gt; Start.</li>\n<li>Wait... spinner... okay, done.</li>\n<li>Mic, sound, webcam. Check. </li>\n<li>Internet + background system. Check.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Don’t use your work computer unless you’re a full admin, with VPN OFF, and you can give <em>full system control</em> to the test app. Restart for a clean slate, and skip the “reopen windows” part. Paperwork? Nada. Until you actually check in. 🗂️</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The truth?</strong> My work laptop was more than fine. They stressed the point until I began to worry, but 0 issues. However, I get pretty much free reign with it. If your's is locked up tighter than admin? You could have issues!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Test Day 🎬😎\n</h2>\n\n<p>When you register, it defaults to an ungodly early time slot — but you can change it to what works for you. (Unless you are that <em><strong>weird morning person</strong></em> who's usually awake with the sun — you know who you are — just a friendly callout payback 😇).</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Sign-In 🛎️🔑\n</h3>\n\n<p>You can sign in up to 30 minutes early. But the second you open that VUE test app, you’re stuck: no phone, no other apps, no moving. Meaning early birds get to wait longer; last-minute folks like me rush in, power nap, and join the waiting line just in time.</p>\n\n<p>After everyone’s in the system:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download app (fresh), system test (again), green light.</li>\n<li><strong>Scan your test space</strong></li>\n<li>Begin exam</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Picture Game: My Desk, My Rules 🖼️🥤\n</h3>\n\n<p>Pearson wants 7 pictures, all from your phone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You, against a solid background. Easy. </li>\n<li>ID, front and back, on a dark surface. Done.</li>\n<li>Workspace: front, back, left, right...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Insert where I made my first mistake — the Pearson Vue phone app lists strict instructions for <em>how</em> they want these pictures. They give you a little diagram to tell you exactly where they want you in relationship to the space when you snap the picture. I'm looking at it and studying... knowing good and well this is not going to work for what they want, but the rules said stand on X so I get as close to X as I can without acrobatics and snap the picture.</p>\n\n<p>Next the \"greeter\" came online (these are the people responsible for making sure your test area meets all criteria for taking the online exam) and of course the pictures aren't clear enough. So we go through the whole “spin around” and show the whole room. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, it’s a live-action improv skit: me, my laptop, and the world’s smallest mouse trap of a space. Yes, Pearson, it's just a Coke. No, there’s nothing else hiding in here unless you count my dignity — which definitely disappeared between picture three and four. 🙈🫠</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Exam Begins: More Dramatics Ensue 🫣🎭\n</h3>\n\n<p>Now that's out of the way, we can get down to business. <strong>Ready, set, go!</strong> Instructions pop up first (read them again). Timer (hide it if you want to stay sane). And Begin. ⏱️</p>\n\n<p>I’m focused, in the zone — then, out of nowhere: <strong>Click. “Is there someone in the room with you?”</strong> Me, blinking at the screen: “No... Oh, wait, I was just talking to myself! I swear I never read a question ou–\" Click. Chat window: “Continue the exam.” 😅</p>\n\n<p>Well.. alright then. I guess we're good. Five minutes later — interrupted <strong>again</strong>: “If you don’t stop talking, I’ll cancel your exam.” <em>WHAT?!</em> “Okay! Not a problem — I'll stop.\" 🤐</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I really could have used a break. Microsoft policy explicitly allows unscheduled breaks (timer keeps running, can’t revisit earlier questions). But... I needed to review everything before submitting, so I just clammed up and finished. It was painful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the time the exam was over I'm super antsy — energy is boiling over from the long stretch of silence — but the only thing left is exactly 7 questions I've flagged for feedback to Microsoft (this is the only way you're allowed to mention anything about specific questions after the test is finished). Checked the timer — 20 minutes left — perfect! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>I told the proctor, “I’m taking a quick break, answers are all submitted.” Stepped five feet away, and suddenly, a <em>new</em> proctor:<br />\n“Hello? Are you there? You need to be in front of the camera!” Door open, I explained, “Just the restroom, all submitted!” “You can’t leave the view of the camera.” Well, I <em>know</em> they didn't want me to take the computer with me — so honestly, what did they want me to do? 😲</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confession:</strong> I was so done with being polite at that point. I'm already jumping out of my skin from the roaring silence for more than an hour. Now even though Microsoft’s policy says unscheduled breaks are allowed at any point, I'm getting threatened for no reason I can discern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After three rounds of “You can’t leave!” with \"But I'm already finished. It's just the feedback.\" I gave up. “Alright – fine! No feedback, then.” Click. Click. Done. ...Crickets. 🦗</p>\n\n<p>I sat there, stunned. Camera turned off, grade popped up — yes, I passed, but <strong>seriously, <em>what just happened</em>?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Later, I went digging and found a Microsoft blog post from 2022 that clearly shows: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>⏸️ Take a Break<code>&lt;/button&gt;</code><br />\nDid my exam have a break button? NOPE. Well then, <em>THAT</em> explains it. 😑🙃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Moral of the Story 💬\n</h2>\n\n<p>I left a very thorough explanation in Pearson VUE’s feedback form. Yes, I was frustrated, but this isn’t about the proctors or the greeters — they were never rude. It’s either training, documentation, or both! </p>\n\n<p>I wish my voice would have made it to Microsoft, because I had <em>plenty to say</em> about their process and I had spent precious time preparing to do so! Now I just hope the next person either gets that missing break button — or at least they update the docs!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Would I do it again?</strong> Absolutely! Things happen. This is my dramatic version of events so you don’t have to repeat my mistakes (and hopefully had a little fun along the way). Besides — ultimately, I got exactly what I wanted when I started! 💞✨</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Nightmare Testing? 🤪\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you (or someone you know) have an “unexpected twist” or “oddly sideways” certification or exam story — please share it below! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, don’t leave me hanging as the only one with this kind of experience? 🙏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🛡️ This was not a solo quest —\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ChatGPT tagged along for the ride 🤖🧑‍💻\n</h3>\n\n<p><em>The content in this post is 100% mine, just censored and sweetened with ChatGPT</em> 🍬✨</p>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Hey, welcome back 👋 If you haven't had a chance to read Part 1 introducing all of the different working parts of GitHub Copilot’s reusable prompts — <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff\">check it out here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before we jump in, ask yourself this: <strong>How well can you anticipate Copilot’s response to your prompts?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If it still feels like a surprise every time, I seriously recommend setting aside 30 minutes to just <em>play</em>. You don’t need anything fancy — no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.</p>\n\n<p>Do you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I’ve been there). Write a prompt for that!</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> you try — the real goal is to see if you can supply <strong>all the info Copilot needs</strong> to get the job done in one go.<br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: GPT models are <em>especially bad</em> at immediate execution. They’ll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely <strong>not</strong> you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling brave? Try your luck with <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. It’s a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once? (I’ll get into all the quirks of Coding Agent in a future post — promise!)</p>\n\n<p>Just know that reusable prompts are built on this same logic — a single message that defines <em>everything</em> needed to complete a task from start to finish.<br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Quick reminder: Copilot is 100% worth <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trying out in Insiders</a>. IntelliJ still owns Java, no question — but you’re missing out on a lot of Copilot’s best tricks if you haven’t made the jump. 🫶</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Reusable Prompts Overview 🧰\n</h2>\n\n<p>Quick recap from last week: A reusable prompt is a combination of an instruction (how to act) and a step-by-step guide. The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>\n<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>\n<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done — nothing more.<br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Personal Guide to Prompting — <strong>PRIOR</strong> 🧭\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let’s cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering. And if you try to search for this or ask Gemini what “PRIOR” stands for, you're probably going to confuse it. Why? Because I made it up. But I promise you — it works!</p>\n\n<p>At its core, it’s a remix of the well-known RICE formula (Role, Instructions, Context, and Examples). RICE didn’t cover everything I needed, so I added more. RICE-O didn’t really stick (honestly, all I could think of was Rice-A-Roni...), so I went back to the drawing board and gave ChatGPT a list of words and synonyms and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I need an acronym I won’t forget — because it would be just like me to have a brilliant idea that could’ve made me a millionaire, and forget it by tomorrow morning.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, <strong>PRIOR</strong> was born — a simple checklist for designing prompts, reusable or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><br /><br />\n<a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftbp0i2q4rsvoekbbcvmd.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftbp0i2q4rsvoekbbcvmd.png\" width=\"700\" /></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 I know — we really didn’t need <em>another</em> acronym or prompt strategy. I get it. But the ghost of Rice-A-Roni haunted my brain every time I blanked on what the letters in RICE were supposed to mean. So I made <em>PRIOR</em> instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fez543wxqzdt527ddk3ad.png\"><img alt=\"Rice-A-Roni box\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fez543wxqzdt527ddk3ad.png\" width=\"76\" /></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For my non-American friends: 📦 <em>Rice-A-Roni</em> is a boxed rice-and-pasta side dish that’s been marketed to Americans since the 1950s as “The San Francisco Treat™.” It’s one of those nostalgic foods you grow up seeing in pantries... but never quite understand why.</p>\n\n<p>Watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT2TfkX6ZeU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ad jingle here</a> — this is what starts playing in my head <em>every single time</em>, like a DeLorean back to the '90s with the radio stuck on loop. ⚡ 🚗 🕰️ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftbp0i2q4rsvoekbbcvmd.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"4\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftbp0i2q4rsvoekbbcvmd.png\" width=\"700\" /></a><br />\n<br /></p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The PRIOR Breakdown (For Real This Time) 🛠️\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Persona 🎭 (actor — <em>not</em> an expert)\n</h3>\n\n<p>First is the <strong>persona</strong>, which is often underutilized and overlooked — and sometimes outright ignored.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>👉 <strong>TL;DR:</strong> A persona doesn’t mean “you’re an expert” — it sets the tone.

But what it really produced was the <em>confidence</em> of that engineer, not the <em>accuracy</em>. So we ended up with a flood of responses that weren’t just wrong — they were <strong>confidently wrong</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"15\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></p>\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  This persona is different.\n</h4>\n\n<p>I’m not telling you to pretend the AI is an expert. I’m telling you to make it a character — <strong>a performer</strong>. Here’s one I wrote recently for summarizing a git diff:<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>  🎩 You are not just analyzing — you’re storytelling with \n  source control. \n  You analyze code with purpose and fervor, then communicate \n  your insights as a short, punchy list — a clever disguise \n  to help users grasp the deeper essence of change they’d \n  otherwise scroll past.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it realistic? Not really. Is it useful? Absolutely. The more engaging and unique the role, the more Copilot leans into it. Wild, weird, or whimsical — it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s <strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>plausible</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Bonus:</strong> It’s just more <em>FUN</em> this way. Try giving Copilot a totally off-the-wall persona — something weird, but still relevant to the task at hand. If it works (or breaks in a hilariously bad way), share your experiment below!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Requirements ✅\n</h3>\n\n<p>Requirements are really just your <em>definition of done</em>. What does it look like when the prompt succeeds?</p>\n\n<p>If we continue with the commit message example, the requirement could be as simple as:</p>\n\n<p><code>Your goal is to output a valid commit message based on the current staged changes.</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Voila</em> — done.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it could get more complex. Maybe you require a conventional commit format, or that it passes <code>commitlint</code>. That’s fine. Just say it clearly, and use <strong>action words</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🔌 Pretend you’re giving instructions to your 10-year-old who refuses to clean their room. You don’t say “Please can you help me tidy up now?” You say: “You MUST clean up this mess before I get back, or I swear I’ll unplug the internet and take the cord with me.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\"><img alt=\"divider\" height=\"15\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsyxxho2t51nzj6q6nul2.png\" width=\"221\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Aside for ALLCAPS 🔠\n</h4>\n\n<p>I’m still not convinced ALLCAPS helps the AI much — but it <strong>does</strong> help <em>you</em>. Humans spot those key phrases easier when they stand out. So go ahead and use the usual suspects from the <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IETF</a>: MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, MAY, ...and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Impediments 🧱\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is just a fancy way of saying: what can go wrong?</p>\n\n<p>These are the critical blockers you want to <em>prevent ahead of time</em>. Impediments help shape the boundaries of your prompt, and again — ALLCAPS works great here.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Isolation</strong>: NEVER combine content from a previous <code>commit.tmp</code> file with a new commit message. ALWAYS start fresh.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No Shortcuts</strong>: You MUST NOT skip any steps or rules. Every line in this prompt must be followed EXACTLY.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Specification</strong>: Follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification EXACTLY</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>❓ Have ALLCAPS action rules helped you at all? Let me know in the comments!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Outcomes 📤\n</h3>\n\n<p>If you don’t tell Copilot <em>exactly</em> what outcome you expect, you risk a whole world of \"not what I meant.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ask for a commit message, and it might do that <em>plus</em> push the branch, delete your fork, and wipe out staging. (If you missed the wildly dramatic retelling of <em>how I know</em>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">you’ll find it here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>That’s where structured output helps. So spell it out. Want a file? Say that. Want it in the chat? Say that. Want both? Say <strong>that</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip</strong> Copilot performs better when you give it structure. Block off output in a code block (<code>json</code>, <code>bash</code>, <code>markdown</code>, etc.) and tell it what each section means. It helps Copilot stay on track and makes the output easier to copy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  References 📚\n</h3>\n\n<p>References = examples. But don’t just show good examples — show bad ones, too. And explain <strong>why</strong> they’re wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1: Valid Commit Message</strong> ✅</p>\n\n<p><code>feat(api): Add new endpoint for user authentication</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Proper capitalization</li>\n<li>No ending punctuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2: Valid Commit Message</strong> ✅</p>\n\n<p><code>build!(deps): Update dependencies to version 2.0, v1.0 no longer supported</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking changes indicator (<code>!</code>) placed properly</li>\n<li>Clear guidance on how to handle the upgrade</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3: Invalid Commit Message</strong> ❌</p>\n\n<p><code>feat(api): add new endpoint for user authentication</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Subject line must be capitalized after the colon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example 4: Invalid Commit Message</strong> ❌</p>\n\n<p><code>build(deps)!: Update dependencies to version 2.0 for all dev dependencies, v1.0 no longer supported</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Subject line is too long and the <code>!</code> is in the wrong place.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The point</strong>: don’t just say “do this” — explain the <em>why</em>, too, using repeatable patterns in a format that Copilot (or anyone) will understand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Putting It All Together 😈🧌\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s what <strong>PRIOR</strong> looks like in action — all five parts, working together in a single, small, reusable prompt.</p>\n\n<p>This one lives in <code>ask</code> mode — no tools, no diffs, no file writes.

To be honest, I really didn't expect my mostly random experiments into GitHub Copilot to be more than a learning experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Confession\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first decided to start blogging, it was <strong>just another random experiment</strong> to see what would happen... just a sly way to gauge the general response to my ideas before I non-officially stuck a \"MINE\" flag in the SME title for Copilot at work. 🏴‍☠️</p>\n\n<p>It was never meant to be more than that — <em>just a quick test</em> I was only semi-invested in. Honestly, I invested <em>just enough</em> to know whether or not to change my strategy before shouting it to the rest of the company. That was the sum total of my initial intent.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Fast forward\n</h2>\n\n<p>I somehow ended up with <strong>actual people followers</strong> (you know — <em>real people</em>, not bots!). Now these posts are going to LinkedIn too (thanks for starting that <a class=\"mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/georgekobaidze\">@georgekobaidze</a>!) Eventually, I’ll get them back to Confluence where they were supposed to be originally anyway (although this is definitely <em>way more fun</em>)! 🤩</p>\n\n<p>So, sincerely — thank you to everyone who’s encouraged or supported me along the way. I wouldn’t still be writing these without you! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if you’re just lurking in the background — I see you, too. 👀 <br />\nYou be you. Just don’t be afraid to join the party sometimes, yeah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After a couple months of posting, I’ve realized this blog isn’t going anywhere. And even though Dev.to is super casual, I didn’t want to start shouting into the void at random without first setting a <em>tiny</em> bit of structure. 🤏</p>\n\n<p>Plus, I work better under pressure. So think of this next part as my self-applied <strong>anti-procrastination machine</strong> fueled by too much caffeine. ⏱️☕</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  📅 1. Weekly Copilot Posts\n</h3>\n\n<p>Every Wednesday morning(ish), expect a new post diving into my current favorite topic: GitHub Copilot. You can expect the useful, the weird, the frustrating, the dramatic — and everything in between. That could be lunchtime in London, dinnertime in Delhi, or “oops I overslept (<em>again</em>)” on the East Coast. ⏰</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> It’s not that I <em>can’t</em> schedule them at the exact same time every week... it just physically hurts to not sprinkle in a little \"unpredictable\" (welcome to my brain!) I might be able to handle the structure, but I need that tiny piece of random to keep my inner Loki happy. 🦊</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So - <strong>same-ish time every Wednesday = GitHub Copilot</strong>, give or take an hour from 8AM EDT.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🌪️ 2. Surprise Posts (Like This)\n</h3>\n\n<p>The rest? Unfiltered, unscheduled, mildly chaotic, and completely unpredictable “thought dumps” that don’t fit neatly into a Copilot post. Even I don't know when a moment will strike! Like this one (and the other few random thoughts in my ChatGPT that are sure to follow soon).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the unannounced bursts of “I have thoughts and <em>SOMEBODY</em> should listen!” But mostly driven by the tiny Gremlin at the keyboard that occasionally hijacks my routine just for fun. 👾</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that's my \"un-officially official\" plan — no backing out now. But honestly... I've been having a blast! Y’all are awesome, and I couldn’t have found a better group of people to share, chat, and learn with. 💕</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What About You? 💬\n</h2>\n\n<p>What’s your favorite part of Dev that keeps you coming back for more (besides the memes)?</p>\n\n<p>And for the writers out there — what’s your one thing that drives you to keep sharing? If you could pick <strong>only one</strong>, what’s the spark that drives you to click <a href=\"https://dev.to/new\"><code>Create Post</code></a>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🎁 Bonus points if you’ve ever gotten a completely unhinged or unexpected response to something you posted. Drop the best one below — I live for those moments!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And stay tuned because there's more on the way – bright and “way-too-early-for-me-to-be-awake” in the morning! ☀️</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>🛡️ <strong>I wasn’t alone:</strong> This post was written by me &amp; ChatGPT: fueled by mischief, markdown, and a little side of magic. 🪄✨</p>",

That’s just how it goes in my head - always at full throttle, but rarely in a straight line. 🌪️</p>\n\n<p>So grab your favorite over-caffeinated iced drink (mine: grande, iced midnight, extra espresso, real vanilla cream - liquid chaos in a cup ☕️❣️) and settle in. Here’s everything I know about Copilot’s reusable prompts - Part 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why This Isn’t Another Wall of Copilot Prompts 🧱\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you ever searched for best practices when it comes to Copilot? You usually end up with either a block that can't even be considered a whole sentence on it's own <em>OR</em> the wall is so gigantic you don't even know where to start reading? </p>\n\n<p>You're really curious though - so you dive in at the first place you see, and then last about 30 seconds... About the time all those AI lines start to blur together you think, “There’s no way anyone actually does all this in real life?”</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I’m probably <em>that</em> person who wrote half the wall (or more) to begin with! Good news for you though, is that: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I'm not going to do that do you now, and </li>\n<li>I do a great job of finding out all the things that absolutely <strong>will not work</strong> no matter what you try (so you don't have to!) ☺️</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's my \"boiled-down-to basics\" version of GitHub Copilot's Reusable (and still experimental) Prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  ✨📁 Copilot’s File Types, Explained\n</h2>\n\n<p>Ever wonder how Copilot instructions and prompts show up in real life? Here’s what it actually looks like in a real project:</p>\n\n<p>► <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> — This is your repo’s “how to act” guide for Copilot and is <em>always</em> in context. It sets the baseline behavior for your project and tells Copilot what to expect from your workflow and contributors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Using what you know about our current release system, write a git command to view the total number of commits pushed to main since the last tagged version.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>► <code>.github/instructions/secure-coding-principles.instruction.md</code> — Think of this as a reusable, specialized playbook. Use these for rules or guidelines you want Copilot to follow everywhere, or for specific situations - like always doing a security review, or making sure React code has matching tests.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>With rules defined in #secure-coding-principles.instruction.md, perform a thorough code review of all staged changes. When you are finished, post a new pull request review with all your comments or suggestions for changes to meet minimum guidelines defined by this repo.\n---\nWith everything you know from the #rules-for-react.instruction.md, build a new component for the frontend along with unit and integration tests.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>► <code>.github/prompts/something-for-copilot-to-do-regularly.prompt.md</code> — This is where you automate repeatable workflows. It’s a set of step-by-step instructions Copilot can follow whenever you trigger it with a slash command in chat.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>/generate-conventional-commit using only staged changes for JIRA-1234.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🐉 Who needs to memorize Vim macros or survive Emacs keybindings when you can just hit “/” in the chat and watch Copilot handle the rest?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Quick Review 📕\n</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 Not on VS Code (or Insiders) yet? Now’s your chance to give it a real shot - features like this hit VS Code Insiders <em>months</em> before anywhere else. For now, it’s the best way to test reusable prompts hands-on, so go ahead and grab it if you haven’t already.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know I’ve written a lot about models - like in <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/build-it-better-real-world-ai-coding-with-github-copilot-1d47\">AI Coding with GitHub Copilot</a> and <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/troubleshooting-production-with-github-copilot-the-guide-for-real-humans-and-bots-with-good-taste-253o\">Troubleshooting Production with GitHub Copilot</a> - but I haven’t spent much time on chat modes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💎 And no, not the same as \"Custom Chat Modes\" (which is also super cool - I promise I’ll cover those soon!).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before we jump in, let’s hit pause and rewind. It’s time for a quick, back-to-basics look at what actually matters when deciding what work you want Copilot to do - and how much control you want over how it gets done.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Chat Modes at a Glance 🎛️\n</h3>\n\n<p>Here’s where things get interesting: Copilot doesn’t just work in one “mode” - it’s got a whole range, from chill Q&amp;A to full-on automation beast. Pick your mode wisely!</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mode</th>\n<th>What It Does</th>\n<th>When To Use</th>\n<th>Power Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ask</td>\n<td>Answers questions, suggests ideas - your personal Stack Overflow, minus the snark.</td>\n<td>Research, quick advice, copy snippets</td>\n<td>🟢 Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edit</td>\n<td>Changes code in-place, optimized for speed—think “find and replace,” but actually smart.</td>\n<td>Step-by-step or explicit code changes</td>\n<td>🟡 Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Agent</td>\n<td>Multi-step, can use tools, context, and reasoning.

If you’ve got questions, wild theories, or even better, your own examples... drop them in the comments! 🚦💬</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Gist of Models 🦾\n</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>✨ I know, I reuse this table a lot - but hey, good models deserve a callback.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Model</th>\n<th>Best For</th>\n<th>Notes &amp; Quirks</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GPT-4.1, GPT-4o</td>\n<td>Creative debugging, “Where do I start?”</td>\n<td>Needs hand-holding on long tasks.

There's not much to cover here after you know they exist and where to find them. Unless you're making friends with every MCP server and already met your \"128 selected tool\" limit, there's not much reason to mess with them much. Just make sure they're all selected and available for Copilot to execute when prompted and you're set. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my personal top-5 built-in tools, that somehow <em>always</em> manage to sneak into any reusable prompt I write:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#changes</code> gives Copilot the ability to see a git diff for your workspace</li>\n<li>\n<code>#codebase</code> all-season access to your repo (and sometimes should be more targeted, but when in doubt this is a good start!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runTests</code> is just what it sounds like and let's Copilot execute any part or all of your test suite</li>\n<li>\n<code>#runInTerminal</code> is the basic run-of-the-mill access to Copilot's very own integrated terminal (separate from yours!)</li>\n<li>\n<code>#editFiles</code> is the tool Copilot needs to make any changes within your repo. If you're expecting Agent Mode to start implementing features, you're going to need this!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> In Agent mode, click the wrench (Configure Tools) at the bottom of Copilot Chat to pick exactly which tools Copilot can use. If you share prompts, call out any non-default tools - just like listing dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Bonus Tools — More Power, More Fun 🛠️✨🎉\n</h4>\n\n<p>Some of my favorite extras come from the <a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/rovo/docs/getting-started-with-the-atlassian-remote-mcp-server/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atlassian MCP-Remote</a> server, but if you have the ability to install GitHub Apps then check out <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/atlassian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rovo</a>, too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>#getJiraIssue</code> lets Copilot pull all the details for a story.</li>\n<li>\n<code>#addCommentToJiraIssue</code> posts your summary as you (so add your RAI disclaimer!).</li>\n<li>\n<code>#createConfluencePage</code> &amp; <code>#updateConfluencePage</code> — still figuring out the best way to teach Copilot “Atlassian style” <code>.confluence</code> syntax (it’s a work in progress 🫠).</li>\n<li>\n<code>#mermaid-diagram-validator</code> checks your diagrams with the official Mermaid extension.</li>\n<li>\n<code>#copilotCodingAgent</code> — brand new, and I can’t wait to see what it can do! Assign it a task and let it work while you keep pairing in Copilot Chat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💎 <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/about-copilot-coding-agent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coding Agent has serious limitations</a>, so check the docs before letting it run wild!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  📨 Commit Message Magic: One Slash to Rule Them All\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here's an example of a basic, yet realistic prompt that generates a commit message. No Jira, no testing, no terminal magic - just one clear task. This is a great way to test prompt building before layering on more steps or complicated conditional logic. </p>\n\n<p>In VS Code, paste this directly into the prompts folder shown or open the command palette and search for <code>Chat: New Prompt File...</code> and then choose whether to store the prompt at the repo-level in <code>.github/prompts</code> or globally for use across all of your workspaces. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <code>.github/prompts/generate-commit-message.prompt.md</code><br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">mode</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">ask</span>\n<span class=\"na\">description</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"pi\">|</span>\n    <span class=\"s\">This prompt is used to generate a commit message based on changes staged in a Git repository.</span>\n<span class=\"na\">tools</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n<span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s\">changes</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># Generate Commit Changes Prompt</span>\n\nReview all code currently staged and use your chat history, if available, to populate details about the changes.

So, if you try to load this and see syntax errors try this instead:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<code>description</code>: 'Enter the description in single quotes on the same line and without the <code>|</code>'</li>\n<li>\n<code>tools</code>: ['changes'] &lt;!-- Define in an array instead of a list, with each tool name as a string --&gt;</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Executing Reusable Prompts\n</h3>\n\n<p>Once you have this (or any other) reusable prompt stored in VS Code, use a slash command to invoke it in the chat interface. Given the above example, you'd prompt Copilot in the chat with something like<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>/generate-commit-message consider only staged files and generate a new commit that starts with a unique emoji\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering all the rules I have set up elsewhere outside of that reusable prompt, I still ended up with a nice clean conventional commit (for the most part).<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>🦄 chore: update commit message generation prompt for clarity\n\n• Instructs to review all staged code and use chat history for context\n• Requires concise, informative commit messages following conventional commit standards\n• Specifies format: clear type, subject, and bullet points for details\n• Ensures only staged changes are considered for commit message generation 😊👍\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 For this example, I actually <em>tried</em> to make Copilot break my own repo-rules - total role reversal. Turns out, it’s stubborn! Even when I begged it to ignore my instructions and forget conventional commit standards, it flat-out refused. 🤣</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Let’s Break It Down: How a Reusable Prompt Really Works ⚡️\n</h2>\n\n<p>Every reusable prompt has exactly two parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>YAML frontmatter:</strong> Everything between the first <code>---</code> (at the top) and the next <code>---</code> marks your frontmatter.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Prompt instructions:</strong> The main body - break your instructions into small, reusable chunks, just like you would with code.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> The more targeted your prompts and instructions, the easier they are to reuse, test, and share later. Treat them like mini code modules - precise, focused, and easy to swap out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🧾 YAML Frontmatter: Your Prompt’s Control Panel\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>mode:</strong> We’re using <code>ask</code> mode because we only need Copilot to generate text, not generate code or run tests.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>description:</strong> A quick, human-friendly summary of what this prompt does. Great for organizing and sanity-checking as your prompt list grows.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>tools:</strong> List all the tools Copilot can use when running this prompt. Keep it tight - less is usually more!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>model:</strong> Enter the name of a model exactly as it appears in the chat model dropdown or leave this out if you want to try different ones or let the user pick. If you do specify one, Copilot will always use that model for this prompt and nothing else.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Frontmatter isn’t actually required for your reusable prompt to work! If you leave out <code>mode</code> or <code>model</code>, Copilot just uses whatever settings the user picked in the chat. No <code>description</code>? No big deal (but it helps keep things organized). The only one to really watch: skipping <code>tools</code> — sometimes you’ll be fine, sometimes Copilot will get stuck, all depending on the user’s VS Code setup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  💬 Reusable-Style Prompt Engineering: Speak Human, Think Modular\n</h3>\n\n<p>The second section in your <code>.github/prompts/reusable-prompt.prompt.md</code> file is where you write out, in natural language, the exact instructions Copilot should follow - just like you would if you were prompting it in chat. You can reference <code>#tools</code>, <code>#files</code>, <code>@participants</code>, other <code>/prompts</code>, and <code>#instructions</code> right here. If you ever catch yourself copying and pasting instructions between prompts, that’s your signal: split it up, give things a clear name, and keep each prompt focused on a single, repeatable workflow.</p>\n\n<p>The best reusable prompts are <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>specific</strong>, not giant copy-paste walls. If you can automate it or break it down into smaller pieces, do it! That way, you (and your team) can mix, match, and remix prompts to build bigger automations down the line - without losing your mind or having to decode a mysterious black box later.</p>\n\n<p>When you’re practicing on your own, start small and build up - tweak one thing at a time and watch how even tiny prompt or context changes can totally flip the results.

What follows is nearly identical to my replies to those posts - plus a quick summary of the original articles (so you don’t need to click and give them extra views; trust me, you’re not missing anything) - along with my own perspective, so you know just how strongly I feel about this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to copy, share, and amplify. Let’s work together to push back against this kind of fear-mongering and make it clear to every person - young or old: <strong>mental health struggles are never your fault.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  First, a PSA for anyone who needs it:\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis <strong>in the U.S., you can call <a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">988</a></strong> anytime, day or night, for free support. 988 is for any topic, offers support in English and Spanish (interpreters for other languages), and lets you talk, text, chat online, or use VP. There’s even a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/support-education/nami-helpline/teen-young-adult-helpline/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teen &amp; Young Adult Helpline (#TalktoUs)</a> with peer support - again, all free and confidential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you’re outside the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/find-help\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HelpGuide.org</a> lists helplines for several other countries</strong>, including the UK, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines, Ireland, Australia, Canada, and India. It’s not global (yet), but it’s a start.</p>\n\n<p>It’s <em>critical</em> to recognize warning signs for early mental health crisis intervention and know how to support someone who might be experiencing first-episode psychosis (often seen in teens and young adults prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia). Hallucinations and delusions are well-known symptoms, but early signs <strong>can also look like depression</strong>. There’s no cure, but schizophrenia and related disorders are very treatable - and treatment today usually means medication and counseling, not hospitals or “scary” interventions. Some helpful resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/what-is-mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SAMHSA: Schizophrenia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI: About Schizophrenia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NIMH: Statistics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nami.org/press-releases/the-michael-laudor-tragedy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI: The Michael Laudor Tragedy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Now, to the posts\n</h2>\n\n<p>The central claim of these posts is that the rapid adoption and widespread, frequent use of AI - particularly chatbots like ChatGPT - is responsible for what the author describes as a rise in mental health disorders among teens and young adults. While the term “psychosis” is used (rather than “schizophrenia”), the narrative strongly implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship that simply isn’t supported by research.</p>\n\n<p>The author includes an anecdote about a young person who used ChatGPT as a sort of “friend,” supposedly leading them to blur the lines between technology and reality.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  My Biggest Problem with This\n</h2>\n\n<p>This conversation is so important - but let’s clear something up: blaming AI (or any single thing) for youth mental health or psychosis isn’t just misleading; it’s flat-out <em>unhelpful</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we take the story at face value (there’s no supporting evidence or sources provided, so that’s a <em>big if</em>), <strong>it is absolutely NOT their fault!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The mere <em>suggestion</em> that a serious, life-altering condition like psychosis could be caused by something a person - young or old - did or didn’t do is not just <em>incorrect</em> and <em>unhelpful</em>, it’s <em><strong>dangerous</strong></em>. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of thinking is exactly why so many people are hesitant to seek help: they feel like it’s something they “brought on themselves” or could have prevented. The truth is, it’s not anyone’s fault - least of all your own.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Truth about Psychosis\n</h2>\n\n<p>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders typically first appear in teens and young adults, but that’s not because of the latest tech trend.</p>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been true long before anyone worried about AI, TikTok, or even Pac-Man.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>teams</em> of experts actively researching what causes psychosis - technology is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle that includes genetics, environment, stress, trauma, and yes, sometimes technology use (in many forms).</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2817594\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2024 study</a> found only a <strong>modest link</strong> between higher computer use in mid-teen years and later psychotic experiences, and even that was mostly explained by other risk factors (mental health and social challenges were present <em>before</em> the high computer use). No clear “cause and effect,” just a reminder that life is complicated and brains even more so.</p>\n\n<p>This is a serious medical topic. Blaming TV, games, the internet, or AI for psychosis is the same tired playbook people have used for decades, and it only makes it harder for people to ask for help. Mental illness is never as simple as a single cause, and fear-mongering or finger-pointing helps no one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why This Is Important to Me\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Those Closest to Me\n</h3>\n\n<p>I grew up with someone in my household who had an untreated mental health condition. It wasn’t schizophrenia, but it deeply shaped my world from my earliest memories. It wasn’t “good” or “bad” - it was simply normal for me. Years later, after I was grown, they finally received help. I wish I could say it was a storybook turnaround. There were good stretches, and some not-so-good ones. Did all those years without support play a role in how things are now? I can’t say for sure - but I know it didn’t help.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  My Own Journey\n</h3>\n\n<p>I was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition in my early twenties (and I’m always willing to talk about it privately if anyone needs support - just reach out). Honestly, I felt “different” long before I ever got the diagnosis. I couldn’t quite name it, and for a long time I just assumed I was “off” in some way. Admitting there might be a problem took a <em>long</em> time; actually seeking help took <em>even longer</em> and was often inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t until college, when I signed up for free counseling sessions (for reasons I can’t even remember - probably thanks to a sibling who worked in the office), that things started to shift. My counselor, Maggie, was the definition of approachable and probably saved my life more than once. One of the first things she did was encourage more frequent sessions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A quick PSA:</strong> Finding the right counselor or therapist can be pure luck - or it can take a lot of searching. If you tried once and it didn’t click, don’t give up. Your “Maggie” is out there, but you’ll never meet them if you don’t keep looking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with counseling for a long time (in addition to other treatment). Life eventually took us in different directions, and it hasn’t always been as easy since, but I learned how to show up for myself and talk about it. Some days I’m better at it than others, but overall, I’m a happy, healthy adult - and, most importantly, I finally <em>feel</em> normal.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Ripple Effects\n</h3>\n\n<p>Out of respect for my family’s privacy, I won’t go deep here. But as an adult, I’ve seen firsthand how mental health issues can affect not just individuals, but entire families - even those who don’t live under the same roof. The big lesson: it’s not just okay to talk about mental health and seek help - <strong>it’s essential</strong>. The person in my life who struggled is doing much better now, thanks to a treatment plan that worked for them and continued care.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Be Part of the Solution to Mental Health\n</h2>\n\n<p>Mental health struggles - crisis or not - are <em>never</em> caused by one thing, and they’re never solved by one thing. It takes understanding, openness, and the willingness to address tough topics. Spreading rumors or horror stories like “ChatGPT made her crazy!” only hurts people who are already suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please, be part of the solution. Share. Talk. Show up. Somebody needs it more than you know.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s focus on compassion, understanding, and <em>real</em> support for those struggling - not easy answers or scapegoats. 💛</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🛡️ This post was created with compassion, understanding, and the help of ChatGPT.</p>\n</blockquote>",

    "content_html": "<p>It hit me the other day - I haven’t been great about adding RAI disclaimers (especially around here). Most of the time I remember, but when I’m deep in the zone - or stuck on that “Copilot, just LISTEN!” rollercoaster - it’s easy to forget.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I’ve gone back and added those RAI footers (like I should’ve from the start), let’s take a real look at what actually matters - and how you can handle it, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🙏 Not an expert - just someone sharing what I’ve learned in the wild. If you spot something out-of-date or just plain wrong, drop a comment. Help me help <em>everyone</em> - no shame, just learning!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  ⚡ TL;DR\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>🧰 <strong>Copilot is a tool, not a magic wand.</strong> Your name’s on the code - no matter who (or what) wrote it.</li>\n<li>👀 <strong>RAI is everyone’s job.</strong> Know Copilot’s strengths <em>and</em> blind spots before you release.</li>\n<li>📝 <strong>Disclose everything!</strong> If Copilot helped, make it obvious - especially in reports, docs, and commits.</li>\n<li>🫱🏾‍🫲🏼 <strong>Not every fix is an AI job</strong> - there are times only you (with your team) can solve it.</li>\n<li>🔬 <strong>Don’t skip basics:</strong> Plan, test, document - don’t get lazy just because AI’s fast.</li>\n<li>🧃 <strong>No AI scapegoats:</strong> Copilot’s just a sidekick. If it leads you off a cliff, you were still in the captain’s chair.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🌈 What Is Responsible AI (and Why Care)?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Think “college ethics class” plus a heavy sprinkle of real-world weirdness. RAI is primarily about two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How the provider (GitHub, Microsoft, etc.) designs and delivers Copilot</strong> - safe, fair, and transparent. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want the official version? <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check Microsoft's builders page</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>How you use Copilot (or any AI)</strong> - what you build, how you share it, and what you let out into the world. That’s the half I’m tackling here.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🔒 The “Yeah, But” List: Copilot Limitations\n</h2>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide?tool=vscode#limitations-of-github-copilot-chat\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub’s official docs</a>, plus my spin for maximum realness:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Limited Scope:</strong> Obscure tech? Weird edge case? Copilot’s probably lost before you get started.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Potential Biases:</strong> Yes, it can <em>learn</em> and <em>perpetuate biases</em>, just like people do. Keep your eyes peeled.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Security Risks:</strong> AI can accidentally leak secrets or create vulnerabilities. Don’t copy-paste blindly!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Matches with Public Code:</strong> That “original” Copilot snippet might be living its best life somewhere else on GitHub already.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Inaccurate Code:</strong> Looks right, compiles... until it doesn’t. 🤷‍♀️</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Terrible at Non-Code Stuff:</strong> If you ask Copilot about philosophy or pop stars, prepare to get answers from another galaxy.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Web Search Responses:</strong> If your org allows, Copilot sometimes Googles and pastes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That’s about as reliable as Rachel Berry mid-song, checking her phone for lyrics - confident, but don’t trust it for your solo! 🎤</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🕹️ If You Code It, You Own It!\n</h2>\n\n<p>Heard “you break it, you bought it”? Copilot’s version: “you code it, you’re on the hook.” No late-night support call will blame the AI. The only fee you’ll pay is in lost sleep and an overage of Slack messages.</p>\n\n<p>If you sneak in a “five-minute fix” without tests, it <em>will</em> bite back - and guess whose name is at the top of <code>git blame</code>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🙏 Don’t be that person whose only excuse is, “Copilot said it was fine!” That’s not the new “it was like that when I got here” - don’t let it start.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  👀 Now What? AI Out Loud\n</h2>\n\n<p>Wondering what all this RAI talk means for you in the real world? Here’s the deal: any time AI helps out - own it, label it, and make sure everyone else can see it too. Transparency is the new black.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  For Generated Reports &amp; Docs\n</h3>\n\n<p>If Copilot whipped up your report (and it’s not code), just tack on a quick footer. Seriously - a copy, a paste, and you’re done. Want to automate it? Set up a user instruction and let Copilot add the credit line for you:<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>---\n\nGenerated with the help of GitHub Copilot, as directed by [YOUR NAME]\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🕰️ If you want a timestamp, copy it in yourself. Trusting Copilot with dates is like asking your dog to set your alarm - cute, but you’re gonna be late.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🏷️ For Commits\n</h3>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Step One: Embrace Conventional Commits\n</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪦 Confession: I used to be the world’s <strong>worst committer</strong>! think “welp, THAT didn’t work” as a real commit message. And yes, it happened more than once...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Eventually, I went on a mission to find a clear, repeatable way to flag my AI-assisted commits. The answer? <a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conventional Commits</a> (plus a linter for good measure). </p>\n\n<p>Never seen one? Here’s what it looks like:<br />\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>feat(api): [JIRA-123] Add api for xyz\n\n[optional bulleted list of changes]\n\n[footers - where the magic happens]\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 <strong>Bonus:</strong> You get automated changelogs for just a <em>little</em> extra setup! Honestly, that’s what finally convinced me to use them every single time - no turning back.</p>\n\n<p>🪧 There are plenty of tools out there to help, too! Everything from classic git templates to handy CLI fill-in-the-blanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Step Two: My DIY Commit Disclosure Guide\n</h4>\n\n<p>Since there's no true standard for this (at least, not yet), I want to share my (no-royalties-required) system for full commit-styled AI disclosure. </p>\n\n<p>In every single commit, I add 2 separate footers: one stating exactly how Copilot was involved (cause it <em>always</em> does something) and one is my \"signature\" that I reviewed, tested, and approved the implementation. </p>\n\n<p>If Copilot played multiple roles? Keep it simple - go with the footer that best matches the most AI hands-on contribution.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If Copilot only wrote the commit message:<br />\n</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>  Commit-generated-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If I paired with Copilot (clear prompt and step-by-step direction):<br />\n</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If Copilot wrote most of the code (here, go implement this story):<br />\n</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>  Generated-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Always:<br />\n</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>  Signed-off-by: Ashley Childress &lt;1234-no-reply@github.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>(or your name - unless you really want to blame me 😆)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So at 3am, when Future You (or some poor teammate) <code>git blame</code>s a file, you’ll know who did what. There's really no official standard yet, so go wild - or just slap a robot emoji 🤖 in there and call it done. <strong>Just make it clear and take credit (or blame).</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🚫 Top 3 “Copilot, Stay in Your Lane!” Moments\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I was little, my Granny would always say, “Sometimes, you’ve just got to wear your big girl panties.” Translation: there are times when you have to face the music and just deal with what’s in front of you - no shortcuts. If you let Copilot trash production... well, those are the only pants you’re getting.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Copilot is a tool, not a magician.</strong> It’s been <em>confidently wrong</em> enough times to make me seriously question reality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Me: “Where’s that logic <em>actually</em> coded?\" <br />\nCopilot: *conjuring code like a magician’s neverending handkerchief*<br />\nMe: “You’ve got to be kidding me...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>You’re the adult in the room.</strong> You have to know not just what Copilot <em>can</em> do, but also what it <em>can't</em> (or <em>shouldn't</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Don't be afraid to bench Copilot.</strong> Real debugging is sometimes just you, four friends, and a bunch of “what if...” ideas. AI’s not built for that kind of chaos. 🫠</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🥊 Avoid Git Blame Drama\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Start with a plan</strong> - don’t just wing it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Try prompting Copilot with TDD</strong>, but know its tests can be as shallow as a kiddie pool if you don't provide the right context and criteria.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Never accept code you don’t understand</strong> - have Copilot ELI5 every step until you do.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When it matters, write your own tests (or code)</strong>. Copilot sometimes invents magical shortcuts - don’t follow the Keebler Elves into the tree!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Disclose everything!</strong> Tag Copilot’s work in your commit messages, READMEs, or reports. Future You will thank you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  💬 Your turn!\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have a Copilot win, a fail, or an epic facepalm moment? Drop it in the comments - bonus points for memes, hot takes, or your best \"AI tried, I survived\" story. Let’s make RAI actually fun (or at least not completely boring)! ✨</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🛡️ AI Helped, I’m Still to Blame\n</h2>\n\n<p>This post was brewed by me - with a shot of ChatGPT, a splash of sarcasm, and zero disclaimers skipped.

I’ll share what part’s have actually been working at some point, but so far the answer is \"not a lot\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have some ideas, so it's not a lost cause yet! For now though, I'm hovering right around 67% usage and work might actually cut me off if I don't make it to the end of the month 👿</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Codex\n</h3>\n\n<p>Since I already have an OpenAI subscription, I’ve been tinkering with Codex as a potential solution to the lack of premium requests 😱😭 We’ll see how it goes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m <em>trying</em> to give it a fair chance... The <strong>good news</strong> in all this? You remember in my <a href=\"https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh\">nightmare story</a> I mentioned doing some pretty out-there things to get my hands on the enterprise version of the Copilot license? Well, apparently, if you exhaust 100% of your premium requests in less than 4 days <em>AND</em> make sure your boss is <em>instantly</em> aware of the problem - you know, so they understand the <strong>true gravity</strong> of the matter in real-time (which is around 7 PM on a Saturday) - work is suddenly more willing to share 😇 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ChatGPT\n</h3>\n\n<p>I’ve been a long-time user for quite some time, but I wanted to call this guy out - and more specifically, exactly <em>how</em> ChatGPT is involved in all my posts. While Copilot is the topic of most everything I write, ChatGPT is usually busy behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🦄 Don’t worry, I’m sure the obsession will wear off eventually... maybe... oh hell, probably not. Never mind! 😅</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Gemini\n</h3>\n\n<p>Gemini and I aren’t talking much right now - which has everything to do with the beta install I put on my Android before fully realizing what Google had <em>actually</em> done with all the hands-free tools the non-generative assistant used to handle (spoiler: not a damn thing is the answer 😡). So, for now, Gemini’s riding the bench.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m sure that won’t last long. Google might be trailing OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI game, but I’ve never known them to stay at the back of the pack. 🛸</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The (Messy) Human-AI Creative Process 🕹️\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Cover art\n</h3>\n\n<p>That one is easy to guess. I’ve almost perfected a prompt that will keep the primary image content vertically \"squished\" towards the center, so the aspect ratio will match suggested size guidelines after I crop it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today's image is a test in full-size, but it was to good to mess with much, especially considering all the personalities it gave me along the way. 🥸</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Seems like either all of the training data was a perfect square OR more likely it's been trained to output specific sizes and my attempts at a compromise violate that plan.</p></li>\n<li><p>I have a designated project for the banner images and roughly half the time I give it a prompt and just use whatever it spits out at me. The other half, it’s either not at all usable or it’s <em>so terrible</em> I really don’t want to share it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It will take some work for me to go through those, but yes - I at least save them. 🔒</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gimp isn’t AI, but it's my go-to for anything image related. Up until a little bit ago I <strong>thought</strong> I was saving all images with meta tags that included the “Generated by/Edited with” comment, but either it’s just different on this computer or they’re not really being saved like I thought. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m gonna work on that before next post though - those should definitely be there! 🏁</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Blog posts 💬\n</h3>\n\n<p>I’m not about to let AI write the <em>whole thing</em> for me (where’s the fun in that?), but I do rely on it a lot for drafts and edits. Just in case anyone’s wondering how the whole process actually happens, here it is - step by step:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>ONE. <strong>Idea</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I’ll literally have no idea what I'm going to talk about until I actually start writing. Other times, I’ve been saving ideas for weeks! There’s really no rhyme or reason to this, so I just go with it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seems like now that I'm actually in a groove, these \"off-the-usual-topic\" (read <em>Copilot</em>) posts are more frequent, too. 🏎️</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>TWO. <strong>Draft</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IS 100% ME</strong> - sometimes I’m lazy and will dictate to ChatGPT (occasionally Gemini, but we’re on a hiatus right now anyway), but I have an instruction that says specifically do not change anything until I tell you I’m ready to start editing. </p>\n\n<p>So for the majority of the week (and more-than-occasionally late the night before 🤐) I’m working on a relatively cohesive unit to cover a specific <em>something</em> (\"topic\" is usually a stretch, at this point). Typically, the draft version is roughly twice as long as the final version and my posts aren’t exactly short to begin with (I know).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>THREE. <strong>Edits</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this is where it gets a <em>little tricky</em>. I have a custom set of instructions for the blog posts, in which the majority of it is focused on two major things, in order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scan the entire post and make changes wherever needed to remove <strong>unintentional bias</strong>, and for every change you make, summarize it with examples and <strong>show me</strong> why your version is better suited. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m getting better as we go, but it’s really just a safety net so I don’t accidentally put my foot in my mouth after taking the scenic route to my point (it’s a talent).  📸</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep my <strong>original attitude and quirks</strong> as much as possible, but not to the extent that it contradicts the first point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I already trained it a long time ago to censor me. It doesn’t even bring that part up anymore, most of the time anyway. 😶 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>FOUR. <strong>Negotiation</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really don’t have a better word for what happens during this phase, because that’s exactly what it feels like. ChatGPT took my nice story and turned it into something that I only vaguely recognize, so I’ll argue that it’s <em>TOO</em> changed. </p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT argues with me that not everybody understands what a \"holler\" is and that it’s probably already too far off-topic to explain whatever contextual point I wanted to make anyway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's usually accurate, too. 😤</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>FIVE. <strong>Final polish</strong></p>\n\n<p>After we have a <em>final working version</em> (cause I’m still changing it randomly), the quizzing starts for all those words I want to say, but really just cannot put my finger on or I need to convey some sort of emotion or attitude (and I’m getting sick of seeing the same emojis all the time).</p>\n\n<p>This is where the content of the blog conversation in ChatGPT pivots and I’ll have it show me a random 10 emojis that could work for a particular phrase or scenario - I’ll pick from there. Same with section titles and quotes, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>💿 When it comes to titles, quotes, and references - it's rarely as simple as <strong>picking one</strong> from a list. Most of the time, I'll pick parts of at least three and then feed them back to ChatGPT to make coherent again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>SIX. <strong>Final review</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point it’s all loaded into Dev, but I'm still reviewing repeatedly until I can make it from top to bottom without the urge to change something immediately (which can sometimes take a couple days - like this post ⚡️). </p>\n\n<p>There’s typically a whole lot of page swapping (preview &gt; edit &gt; preview) until I’m finally happy with the overall version. From there, most posts get scheduled for Wednesday mornings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🪴 Why? No reason, really - it’s more random chance. I’ve tried to stay on at least a weekly schedule since I joined. If I schedule the big posts, I know I won’t accidentally miss a day. 😇</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  TL;DR: The Heart of the Matter 🫀\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you’ve made it this far, now you know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, I use AI - a LOT</li>\n<li>No, it doesn’t do <em>all</em> the work for me</li>\n<li>Yes, I argue with it (and sometimes lose...)</li>\n<li>No, it hasn’t taken over my personality</li>\n<li>Yes, the cover art is AI-generated\n\n<ul>\n<li>unless it’s truly hideous - those are locked in the vault!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The real secret is that all of this is <em>still me</em>! I’m just occasionally powered up by caffeine and robots. ☕️🤖</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Chime In 🎤\n</h2>\n\n<p>Got tips, tricks, or your own tales of AI chaos?
