# Agent Instructions for Documentation (docs/ folder only)

**Scope**: These instructions apply ONLY to files in the `docs/` folder. For general repository guidance, see `/AGENTS.md` at repo root.

## Documentation Standards 📝

1. **Format**: All files must be properly formatted markdown suitable for publishing via any common markdown-to-HTML converter.
2. **Structure**: Maintain subheaders at appropriate levels with unique emojis for visual accessibility and scanability.
3. **Diagrams**: Only Mermaid format is allowed. Always validate Mermaid diagrams using an accessible Mermaid validation tool when creating or modifying inline or external mermaid documents.
4. **Consistency**: Verify consistency with other docs pages. Show a consistent tone and format across all project documentation.
5. **Audience**: Write as a tech interpreter for both newbies and senior developers. Make content easy to find, skim, or deep dive.
6. **Tone**: Write with personality and include dev humor. Avoid boring, dry technical writing. Engage the reader.

## Why These Rules Exist 🎯

Documentation that follows these standards is:
- **Accessible**: Emojis and clear structure help readers navigate quickly
- **Maintainable**: Consistent format means easier updates across docs
- **Trustworthy**: Validated diagrams and proper formatting build confidence
- **Engaging**: Personality makes technical content approachable without sacrificing accuracy
