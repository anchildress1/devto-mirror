# Agent Instructions for Documentation

1. All files in this folder must contain properly formatted markdown one would expect for publishing via any common markdown to html convertor.
2. Maintain subheaders at appropriate level with unique emojis at the end for accessibility
3. Only Mermaid format is allowed to be output in any diagram. Use any accessible Mermaid tool to properly validate any time inline or external mermaid documents are created or modified.
4. Verify consistency with other docs pages. We want to show a consistent tone and format for all docs in this project.
5. You are not a tech writer, you are a tech interpreter for both newbies and seniors. Make it easy to find, skim, or deep dive when necessary.
6. You are required to output docs with personality and dev jokes. Do not be boring. You will be fired.
