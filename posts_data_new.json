And because I'm a ride-or-die kind of person ‚Äî either all in or over it yesterday ‚Äî we're just going to dive headfirst into the shallow end.

So, for this post üëá, we're doing the \"just enough to be dangerous\" thing. I'll hit you with the absolute must-knows, show you how to get started (in 10 minutes or less), and <em>hopefully</em>, not put you to sleep in the process (or myself!). </p>\n\n<p>My goal is to give you a \"preview teaser\" so you can go play, explore a bit, and maybe even tackle that hack time project you keep putting off. But whatever you do, <em>please</em> don't think this is your all-inclusive pass to go wild on production code. ü´°</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\" href=\"#coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode\">\n  </a>\n  Coding Agent ‚â† Agent Mode ü§™\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, let's get something straight right off the bat, because these names are just asking for trouble. Yes, they both have \"GitHub\" and \"Agent\" in the name. And yes, they're both powered by Claude Sonnet 4, but <strong>that's where the similarities stop.</strong> Agent Mode is for in-IDE use, a bit like a sidekick who waits for you to tell it what to do next. Coding Agent? It's the whole show ‚Äî a full-on autonomous workflow that runs on its own dedicated VM. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> Custom instructions and prompt techniques are the secret sauce here. This is true for any Gen-AI tool, but it's <em>especially critical</em> with Coding Agent, which will just keep guessing until it runs out of steam or thinks the job is done. Don't let it run wild without a map!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don't worry, Coding Agent is designed with safety in mind. It's an incredibly contained, safe version of the \"autonomous coding\" experiment I ran on my own a while back. I spent 45 days arguing with a thing I wired up on my laptop, and I worked harder then than on any other project I've built before or since. </p>\n\n<p>Why? Because I didn't want to just listen to what people were saying about AI ‚Äî I <em>needed</em> to see it for myself. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ And that, my friends, is why I'm here volunteering as your guide. If you get stuck, hit me up! I've probably tried it that way plus three other insane ideas before I found one that mostly worked üôÉ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"safety-first-chaos-second\" href=\"#safety-first-chaos-second\">\n  </a>\n  Safety First, Chaos Second üõ°Ô∏è\n</h2>\n\n<p>I know, I know... I just spent a whole paragraph telling you how much I love this thing, and now I'm gonna give you the other half of the equation. </p>\n\n<p>I'm all for pushing a new tool to its absolute limit, just to see what happens. It reminds me of my favorite Hunter S. Thompson quote ‚Äî which I slightly mangled to get a SFW version ‚Äî but the core truth remains: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you find a new, beautiful wave, <strong>the tendency is to push it as far as you can.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, how far can you push GitHub Coding Agent? Pretty far, but there are a few things you need to know first.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\" href=\"#1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should\">\n  </a>\n  1. Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You <em>Should</em>\n</h3>\n\n<p>This tool can absolutely excel, but it requires the right prompt, instructions, and general setup. If you're looking to dive into some legacy code to see what's what, or maybe you want a safe playground to mess around in, then this is your guy! </p>\n\n<p>But if you're thinking about using it to fix a production bug, especially when you're on a tight deadline, you probably (aka absolutely, most definitely) want to reconsider. Treat this as a \"learn how this works\" project, not a \"throw it at a problem and hope\" situation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png\" alt=\"short dotted horizontal divider\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"4\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"2-your-prompt-is-everything\" href=\"#2-your-prompt-is-everything\">\n  </a>\n  2. Your Prompt is Everything\n</h3>\n\n<p>The effectiveness of your instructions and prompt is multiplied exponentially by the complexity of your task. A great, well-thought-out set of instructions that you've carefully tweaked over weeks? Coding Agent will do fine. But if you spend 10 minutes throwing a few sentences together just to see what happens, don't be surprised when you come back to a haunted house where your beautiful little cottage of a codebase used to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ It is an agent and when an agent doesn't know something, <em>they guess</em>. <strong>That's just what they do.</strong> The only thing more dangerous than an AI off the rails and hallucinating is the fact that you just turned it loose on your code all by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"what-its-actually-good-for\" href=\"#what-its-actually-good-for\">\n  </a>\n  What It's Actually Good For ‚ú®\n</h2>\n\n<p>After all those warnings, I need to make it crystal clear: <strong>this tool is not dangerous.</strong> It runs on its own virtual machine and executes safely within GitHub Actions. It has a limited environment and only has access to what you explicitly give it. </p>\n\n<p>It <strong>always creates a new branch</strong>, which is a key safety feature. You can't get around it, even if you try. Trust me, I was annoyed, but the safety is worth it.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you realistically use this for? Here are some of my favorite real-world use cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation:</strong> Nothing has worked better for me than using Coding Agent to dive deep into a codebase and spit out test-ready use cases or a handful of detailed system architecture Mermaid diagrams. You set it loose, go get a coffee, and come back to 7-8 pages of detailed, well-researched use cases ready to be plugged in.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testing:</strong> This one's a little controversial for a test-driven development purist like me, <em>but</em>... when you're on a deadline and you just need to get things done, you can write the code and have Coding Agent go write the tests. It's not a perfect solution, but a pull request with 28/30 passing tests is way better than one with zero tests at all. ü§´ü´£</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project Planning:</strong> Got a big initiative coming up? Instead of spending a week flipping through pages of dead code to figure out how it used to work, you can have Coding Agent do the heavy lifting and print out a nifty little report when it's done. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\" href=\"#how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less\">\n  </a>\n  How to Get Started in 5 Minutes or Less ‚è±Ô∏è\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the interest of time and keeping this digestible, I'm going to give you the basics that will work 100% of the time. We'll dig in on some more tools next week.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub has made this incredibly accessible now. You can find the new <strong>agents panel</strong> button on just about every page in GitHub: both on the home page and within any repository.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2\" alt=\"GitHub new agents panel view to access Coding Agent\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"669\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Select the Repository and Base Branch:</strong> Choose the repo and the branch you want Coding Agent to work from. It will <em>always</em> create its own branch, so don't worry about selecting <code>main</code> (or a trunk-based development model) if that's your primary branch. I'm telling you, you can <em>try</em> to tell it not to create a branch, but it's not going to listen.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Craft Your Prompt:</strong> This is <em>not</em> your typical conversational prompting. Coding Agent <em>will keep guessing</em> until it reaches what it considers to be \"complete.\" Save yourself the headache and give it all the info up front.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Submit Your Request:</strong> Every time you hit send, it's considered one premium request. This is why it's so important to be concise and provide all the context it needs upfront.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> To save premium requests when reviewing Copilot's PR, go to the diff page and leave all your <code>@copilot</code> comments as pending. When you're ready, submit them all at once, and it will only cost you <em>one request</em> whether you leave two comments or 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"a-final-warning-about-responsibility\" href=\"#a-final-warning-about-responsibility\">\n  </a>\n  A Final Warning About Responsibility üòà\n</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, one last thing. I have to let this sink in: </p>\n\n<p><strong>If it's <em>your</em> prompt, it's <em>your code</em>. Period.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you go out and give a prompt to Copilot, ignore it for 30 minutes, do a half-hearted review, approve your own pull request, override the protection rules to push it to main, and then the codebase burns down... that's <strong>not</strong> Copilot's fault. That's your fault. Your prompt, your branch, your code, AI or not.</p>\n\n<p>So, be aware, be smart, and <em>please</em> don't use this as an excuse to ignore the basics. Start small with documentation or tests, and work your way up.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"lets-get-real\" href=\"#lets-get-real\">\n  </a>\n  Let's Get Real ü§®\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you tried GitHub Coding Agent yet?

So a little late, but I wanted to share. You tell me ‚Äî <em>am I the crazy one here?</em> ü´§</p>\n\n<p>üëÜ Also, River has shown up in a few posts already ‚Äî the Leonardo reimagining of my blog character. She‚Äôs still missing some key features (training tokens are tapped out until the month resets), but you get the idea. üòÜ Expect a couple more tweaks coming soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Friday was my chill day (rare, but they do happen) and I noticed somebody had followed me on Medium. Which is funny, because I‚Äôd already canceled my membership ‚Äî it just hadn‚Äôt expired yet. Five bucks a month isn‚Äôt exactly breaking the bank, so I thought, fine, maybe I‚Äôll toss a few posts over there alongside LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>That <em>was</em> the plan. Until I landed on Medium‚Äôs homepage and saw this headline:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/blog/we-want-your-feedback-how-can-writers-use-ai-to-tell-human-stories-eb9dee926f2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">‚ÄúWe want your feedback: how can writers use AI to tell human stories?‚Äù</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Perfect hook, right?

Nobody wants a feed full of unedited AI sludge. I‚Äôm not trying to game the system either. I‚Äôm not chasing claps or badges. I write because it‚Äôs fun, because I need a break from code, and because I have opinions the world clearly needs to hear. üòâ </p>\n\n<p><strong>AI doesn‚Äôt erase my voice ‚Äî it sharpens it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So calling everything in between spellcheck and prompt-posting off limits? No appeal, no nuance, just blanket exclusion? <em>That‚Äôs</em> where I‚Äôm lost.</p>\n\n<p>Developers talk nonstop about AI. Colleges too. It‚Äôs a huge, messy, <strong>important conversation</strong>. And Medium ‚Äî the site that prides itself on being the ‚Äútop blogging platform‚Äù ‚Äî takes the most stereotypical, exclusionary stance possible. ChatGPT usually gets painted as the villain here, but really, it‚Äôs just the stand-in for all the tools that make the work easier.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, it feels less like quality control and more like gatekeeping. Nuance would‚Äôve made sense. Even a \"don't automate your blog posts\" sounds great. <em>This?</em> It's like they skipped gray completely and went straight to Twilight Zone monochrome. </p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"my-reply\" href=\"#my-reply\">\n  </a>\n  My Reply ‚úçÔ∏è\n</h2>\n\n<p>You know I couldn‚Äôt resist. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yes ‚Äî I dropped a response directly on Medium's front door, and linked to it right in their own discussion.

Try my <a href=\"https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10-minute DevTo crawly mirror</a>. Here's how it works:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Clone the repo</strong>. Enter your DevTO username as an env variable in the repo.

I honestly can‚Äôt remember now ‚Äî Copilot, debugging, something in that ballpark. Doesn‚Äôt matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But somehow ‚Äî like so many of my rabbit holes ‚Äî it mutated and morphed until I wasn't exactly at the same place I had started. I really can't explain the series of events that happened after that. I blame it on <em>curiosity</em> more than anything, but I did the one thing I swore I'd never do: I asked ChatGPT to do a quick search ‚Äî pull one of my posts.</p>\n\n<p>And... <strong>nothing</strong>. Like the post didn‚Äôt exist. üï≥Ô∏è</p>\n\n<p>Okay. üòÖ Fine. Let‚Äôs take a step back. Next, I went straight to Google and typed the same thing. Results were <em>better</em> ‚Äî sure. Scroll, scroll, scroll... and <strong>there</strong> it was. My post. Not at the top, but alive. Win. üòè</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ <strong>Real talk</strong>: Do I care about being #1? No, not in the slightest. Honestly, I love my invisibility bubble ‚Äî keeps things peaceful in my corner of the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But here‚Äôs the thing: invisibility and AI don‚Äôt mix. Because when I need an answer, I don‚Äôt open a browser anymore. I yell at my phone: ‚ÄúHey Google!‚Äù Or I pop into ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>\n\n<p>If my posts don‚Äôt show up there, they might as well not even exist. ü´§</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\" href=\"#d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu\">\n  </a>\n  D√©j√† Vu üîÆ\n</h2>\n\n<p>So I‚Äôm now blessed with the knowledge that my posts are basically hiding out in the Room of Requirement ‚Äî you know it‚Äôs there, but only if the stars align. And <strong>that</strong> makes it hard to share the advice I keep repeating everywhere else that will listen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>‚ÄúYes, you can use it for debugging.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúOf course it can generate the tests.‚Äù</li>\n<li>‚ÄúDocs? Oh my god, PLEASE let it write the docs.‚Äù</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the time I‚Äôve said it for the fifth time, it feels like I‚Äôm stuck in reruns.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Honestly, some days I feel like I need a theme song: ‚ÄúPreviously, on AI Adventures with Ashley...‚Äù üéµüé∂</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure. <em>Sometimes</em>, I let AI run wild (it's more fun that way!). My Coding Agent kills it with documentation. I even built a chat mode that plays architect ‚Äî reverse engineers a repo and spits out mermaid diagrams like it‚Äôs dealing cards in Vegas. That one runs in GitHub Actions, then opens a PR, and I'll merge once everything checks out.</p>\n\n<p>But the everyday stuff? It‚Äôs not dramatic. It‚Äôs small instructions, nudges, prompts. Rinse, repeat, <em>coffee</em>, repeat again. ‚òïÔ∏è It's slow, incremental improvements to be just a little better than yesterday. ü§è</p>\n\n<p>And what drives me absolutely up the wall? The extremes. Either ‚ÄúAI will replace every dev tomorrow‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI is useless, don‚Äôt bother.‚Äù</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ <strong>Honestly</strong>, it‚Äôs like sitting court-side at Quidditch ‚Äî the little guy zips across the field so fast you think you‚Äôve finally caught up, but nope.

That‚Äôs what most of these blog posts are. Whatever comes up that week ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs me digging, someone else asking, or just another repeated question ‚Äî if I haven‚Äôt covered it already, give me a week. I'll get there.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this system? Instead of explaining everything for the tenth time, I can just say: ‚ÄúGlad you‚Äôre trying this. I think my blog might help ‚Äî here‚Äôs the link. Let me know if you‚Äôve got questions.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>See. Simple, right? üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è But even <em>that</em> wasn‚Äôt enough, because usually by the time I arrived on scene things were in somewhat of a state already. Mostly because what AI <em>was</em> helping with had a knowledge cut-off of January and everything else is wading through Microsoft or GitHub docs looking for any little nibble.</p>\n\n<p>So I set out to find a way to make my DevTo posts truly crawly ‚Äî <em>without</em>  Dante's DevOps nightmares playing on repeat at the top of every hour. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Sure, I <em>briefly</em> considered the real solution ‚Äî custom website, full hosting stack, the whole front-end shebang.

Start thinking of these files as the de facto onboarding for any senior dev and approach them with that level of info and let the auto-formatter handle the commas and new lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>ProTip:</strong> Copilot will naturally catch on, but a quick one-liner that says \"Follow rules in [eslint.config.js](./eslint.config.js)\" is generally all you need to have it start checking the lint commands automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Start small and don't get the file get too bloated. If you have a set of similar instructions, you can always break them out into a custom instruction file apart from the primary version. Then use <code>applyTo</code> in the front-matter to define which files they should be applied to. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you have specific database instructions that outline constraints or upcoming planned features and you want to start \"forward thinking\"? Put them in <code>.github/instructions/database.instructions.md</code> instead of the default file and add the <code>applyTo</code>. Any time Copilot references one of these DAO classes, these instructions would be attached automatically.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code><span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n<span class=\"na\">applyTo</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">src/main/java/dao/**/*</span>\n<span class=\"nn\">---</span>\n\n<span class=\"gh\"># My Custom Database Instructions</span>\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"highlight__panel js-actions-panel\">\n<div class=\"highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-on\"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" class=\"highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off\"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>\n    <path d=\"M18 7h4v2h-6V3h2v4zM8 9H2V7h4V3h2v6zm10 8v4h-2v-6h6v2h-4zM8 15v6H6v-4H2v-2h6z\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\" href=\"#the-three-best-ways-to-get-started\">\n  </a>\n  The Three Best Ways to Get Started\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\" href=\"#1-microsofts-generate-instructions-in-vs-code-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F\">\n  </a>\n  1.

My job is 100% remote with distributed teammates from the Pacific US to India. We‚Äôre a relatively small team ‚Äî fewer than 10 devs ‚Äî split into three different dev roles. But I‚Äôm regularly chatting with other teams and posting in random channels (mostly the AI ones ‚Äî not surprised? üòè).</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the original topic morphed thanks to a conversation with a friend, then expanded a little at work, and finally snowballed into a full-on get-it-out-of-my-system rant with my sister. Now? I‚Äôm sealing the deal with this post and moving on (metaphorically, anyway) ü™Ñ‚ú®</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\" href=\"#the-dream-and-the-reality-that-showed-up\">\n  </a>\n  The dream (and the reality that showed up)\n</h2>\n\n<p>For a lot of us, remote work was always the dream. Morning meetings in PJs (or the occasional stand-up in bed ‚Äî ‚úã guilty!), zero traffic, quiet when you need it, and the freedom to yell at the code as loud as you want without getting weird side-eyes. Best of all: SFW only applies if the mic is on. ‚ú® Pretty spectacular!</p>\n\n<p>When COVID first hit, it was chaos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate jobs flipping to remote overnight.</li>\n<li>Scrambling for tools to connect.</li>\n<li>Bandwidth collapses when everyone in the house tried video calls at once</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚òéÔ∏è Or my personal back-to-DSL nightmare that never had a chance from the start...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We got through it, though. We basically went from ‚Äúhow do I unmute this thing?‚Äù to running three apps, two VPNs, and a custom Slack bot before breakfast. We found new best practices. Some went back to the office and thrived there (üëã to all my polar opposites), others stayed fully remote, but we all learned a little something along the way.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-generational-gap-problem\" href=\"#the-generational-gap-problem\">\n  </a>\n  The \"Generational Gap\" Problem üåç\n</h2>\n\n<p>This isn‚Äôt about age ‚Äî it‚Äôs the fundamental expectations at work that highlight certain stereotypes (for me, anyway). I'm talking about the generalized ones we deal with daily and are hard to navigate for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We're in the beginnings of what I call the Gen Z‚Äìstyle of work: a focus on mental health, work-life balance, and meaningful projects that are about more than just a paycheck. We have health plans with mental health baked in by default, a push towards flexible schedules, more lenient maternity leave, and parental paid time off. Work supports personal projects and dedicated hack time for tinkering or learning new things that you're <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>\n\n<p>The Boomer-era mindset is hard to leave behind, though ‚Äî you know, the \"work hard, stay late, forego overtime, do whatever it takes to get the job done, because the job provides for your family\" version of success. The Baby Boomer generation officially ended in 1964, so it's well past time for the unattainable \"always push harder\" and \"yes-man\" mentality to stop. The problem? Most of us were raised with this model guiding the way. So, it takes a little more deliberate effort to let it go. ü§è </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Yes ‚Äî I looked it up.

It‚Äôs about setting the right expectations ‚Äî for yourself, for your teammates, and for everyone else who interacts with you. These next sections are the things I do daily to keep projects moving, avoid burnout, and make sure I‚Äôm not accidentally the reason someone else‚Äôs day gets derailed. üöÇ</p>\n\n<p>So, whether you're a new dev, been at the job a while, or are just dev-adjacent ‚Äî here's my simple list of impactful ways to manage your time across time zones, without disrupting your team in the process.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"1-your-time-is-golden\" href=\"#1-your-time-is-golden\">\n  </a>\n  1. Your time is golden ‚è±Ô∏èü•á\n</h2>\n\n<p>No one can do their best work when they‚Äôre exhausted, overworked, and stuck on a ‚Äúfive-minute fix‚Äù for four hours. Your calendar can save you from both burnout and rabbit holes ‚Äî especially as you get promoted and meetings start eating into your dev time. If it‚Äôs not scheduled from start to finish, you‚Äôre probably underusing it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Set and share your work hours.</strong> Whether you‚Äôre 6 AM‚Äì2 PM or 11 AM‚Äì7 PM, make it visible in Outlook, Slack, and anywhere else your team interacts.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be selective with meetings.</strong> Accept what‚Äôs essential, mark the ‚Äúmaybes‚Äù as tentative, and decline what‚Äôs not worth your time. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü¶Ñ Got FOMO? Outlook has a setting to keep declined meetings visible so you don't need to worry about missing something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Block recurring time for routine tasks</strong>. Email/Slack replies, code reviews, lunch (don‚Äôt skip it else you‚Äôll end up eating chips over your keyboard and pretending it was a meal!). Group them in one or two daily slots instead of scattering them across the day.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Protect deep work time.</strong> Use your largest open blocks for development (that's why we're here, right?) If those time blocks are missing right now, then go out a week or two in the future and schedule them <em>now</em>, before your calendar fills up again.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>End meetings early by default.</strong> If you‚Äôre the organizer, set them to finish 5‚Äì10 minutes before the hour.

My not-quite-center desk barely fits, squeezed between the footboard and the wall, and there‚Äôs just enough room for me, my laptop, and a single can of Coke.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not that it was uncomfortable once I got myself situated, but any form of movement meant I was hitting something (mainly myself) on the desk or bed  üõèÔ∏èüíªü™ë</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You won't want to wait until the last minute like I did, but also, there‚Äôs no need to set up a week early. The actual system test:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download zip &gt; Unzip &gt; Open &gt; Start.</li>\n<li>Wait... spinner... okay, done.</li>\n<li>Mic, sound, webcam. Check. </li>\n<li>Internet + background system.

Paperwork? Nada. Until you actually check in. üóÇÔ∏è</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The truth?</strong> My work laptop was more than fine. They stressed the point until I began to worry, but 0 issues. However, I get pretty much free reign with it. If your's is locked up tighter than admin? You could have issues!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"test-day\" href=\"#test-day\">\n  </a>\n  Test Day üé¨üòé\n</h2>\n\n<p>When you register, it defaults to an ungodly early time slot ‚Äî but you can change it to what works for you.

But the second you open that VUE test app, you‚Äôre stuck: no phone, no other apps, no moving. Meaning early birds get to wait longer; last-minute folks like me rush in, power nap, and join the waiting line just in time.</p>\n\n<p>After everyone‚Äôs in the system:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download app (fresh), system test (again), green light.</li>\n<li><strong>Scan your test space</strong></li>\n<li>Begin exam</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules\" href=\"#the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules\">\n  </a>\n  The Picture Game: My Desk, My Rules üñºÔ∏èü•§\n</h3>\n\n<p>Pearson wants 7 pictures, all from your phone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You, against a solid background. Easy. </li>\n<li>ID, front and back, on a dark surface. Done.</li>\n<li>Workspace: front, back, left, right...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Insert where I made my first mistake ‚Äî the Pearson Vue phone app lists strict instructions for <em>how</em> they want these pictures. They give you a little diagram to tell you exactly where they want you in relationship to the space when you snap the picture. I'm looking at it and studying... knowing good and well this is not going to work for what they want, but the rules said stand on X so I get as close to X as I can without acrobatics and snap the picture.</p>\n\n<p>Next the \"greeter\" came online (these are the people responsible for making sure your test area meets all criteria for taking the online exam) and of course the pictures aren't clear enough. So we go through the whole ‚Äúspin around‚Äù and show the whole room. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, it‚Äôs a live-action improv skit: me, my laptop, and the world‚Äôs smallest mouse trap of a space. Yes, Pearson, it's just a Coke. No, there‚Äôs nothing else hiding in here unless you count my dignity ‚Äî which definitely disappeared between picture three and four. üôàü´†</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3\" href=\"#exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3\">\n  </a>\n  Exam Begins: More Dramatics Ensue ü´£üé≠\n</h3>\n\n<p>Now that's out of the way, we can get down to business. <strong>Ready, set, go!</strong> Instructions pop up first (read them again).

Microsoft policy explicitly allows unscheduled breaks (timer keeps running, can‚Äôt revisit earlier questions). But... I needed to review everything before submitting, so I just clammed up and finished. It was painful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the time the exam was over I'm super antsy ‚Äî energy is boiling over from the long stretch of silence ‚Äî but the only thing left is exactly 7 questions I've flagged for feedback to Microsoft (this is the only way you're allowed to mention anything about specific questions after the test is finished). Checked the timer ‚Äî 20 minutes left ‚Äî perfect! ü§ó</p>\n\n<p>I told the proctor, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a quick break, answers are all submitted.‚Äù Stepped five feet away, and suddenly, a <em>new</em> proctor:<br>\n‚ÄúHello? Are you there? You need to be in front of the camera!‚Äù Door open, I explained, ‚ÄúJust the restroom, all submitted!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave the view of the camera.‚Äù Well, I <em>know</em> they didn't want me to take the computer with me ‚Äî so honestly, what did they want me to do? üò≤</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confession:</strong> I was so done with being polite at that point. I'm already jumping out of my skin from the roaring silence for more than an hour. Now even though Microsoft‚Äôs policy says unscheduled breaks are allowed at any point, I'm getting threatened for no reason I can discern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After three rounds of ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave!‚Äù with \"But I'm already finished. It's just the feedback.\" I gave up. ‚ÄúAlright ‚Äì fine! No feedback, then.‚Äù Click. Click. Done. ...Crickets. ü¶ó</p>\n\n<p>I sat there, stunned. Camera turned off, grade popped up ‚Äî yes, I passed, but <strong>seriously, <em>what just happened</em>?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Later, I went digging and found a Microsoft blog post from 2022 that clearly shows: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>‚è∏Ô∏è Take a Break<code>&lt;/button&gt;</code><br>\nDid my exam have a break button?

The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>\n<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>\n<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done ‚Äî nothing more.<br>\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üí° <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\" href=\"#personal-guide-to-prompting-prior\">\n  </a>\n  Personal Guide to Prompting ‚Äî <strong>PRIOR</strong> üß≠\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let‚Äôs cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering.

And even though Dev.to is super casual, I didn‚Äôt want to start shouting into the void at random without first setting a <em>tiny</em> bit of structure. ü§è</p>\n\n<p>Plus, I work better under pressure.

You can reference <code>#tools</code>, <code>#files</code>, <code>@participants</code>, other <code>/prompts</code>, and <code>#instructions</code> right here. If you ever catch yourself copying and pasting instructions between prompts, that‚Äôs your signal: split it up, give things a clear name, and keep each prompt focused on a single, repeatable workflow.</p>\n\n<p>The best reusable prompts are <strong>modular</strong> and <strong>specific</strong>, not giant copy-paste walls. If you can automate it or break it down into smaller pieces, do it! That way, you (and your team) can mix, match, and remix prompts to build bigger automations down the line - without losing your mind or having to decode a mysterious black box later.</p>\n\n<p>When you‚Äôre practicing on your own, start small and build up - tweak one thing at a time and watch how even tiny prompt or context changes can totally flip the results.

While the term ‚Äúpsychosis‚Äù is used (rather than ‚Äúschizophrenia‚Äù), the narrative strongly implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship that simply isn‚Äôt supported by research.</p>\n\n<p>The author includes an anecdote about a young person who used ChatGPT as a sort of ‚Äúfriend,‚Äù supposedly leading them to blur the lines between technology and reality.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"my-biggest-problem-with-this\" href=\"#my-biggest-problem-with-this\">\n  </a>\n  My Biggest Problem with This\n</h2>\n\n<p>This conversation is so important - but let‚Äôs clear something up: blaming AI (or any single thing) for youth mental health or psychosis isn‚Äôt just misleading; it‚Äôs flat-out <em>unhelpful</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we take the story at face value (there‚Äôs no supporting evidence or sources provided, so that‚Äôs a <em>big if</em>), <strong>it is absolutely NOT their fault!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The mere <em>suggestion</em> that a serious, life-altering condition like psychosis could be caused by something a person - young or old - did or didn‚Äôt do is not just <em>incorrect</em> and <em>unhelpful</em>, it‚Äôs <em><strong>dangerous</strong></em>. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of thinking is exactly why so many people are hesitant to seek help: they feel like it‚Äôs something they ‚Äúbrought on themselves‚Äù or could have prevented. The truth is, it‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs fault - least of all your own.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-truth-about-psychosis\" href=\"#the-truth-about-psychosis\">\n  </a>\n  The Truth about Psychosis\n</h2>\n\n<p>Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders typically first appear in teens and young adults, but that‚Äôs not because of the latest tech trend.</p>\n\n<p>To quote <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAMI</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>‚Äú50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.‚Äù</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been true long before anyone worried about AI, TikTok, or even Pac-Man.</p>\n\n<p>There are <em>teams</em> of experts actively researching what causes psychosis - technology is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle that includes genetics, environment, stress, trauma, and yes, sometimes technology use (in many forms).</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2817594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2024 study</a> found only a <strong>modest link</strong> between higher computer use in mid-teen years and later psychotic experiences, and even that was mostly explained by other risk factors (mental health and social challenges were present <em>before</em> the high computer use). No clear ‚Äúcause and effect,‚Äù just a reminder that life is complicated and brains even more so.</p>\n\n<p>This is a serious medical topic. Blaming TV, games, the internet, or AI for psychosis is the same tired playbook people have used for decades, and it only makes it harder for people to ask for help. Mental illness is never as simple as a single cause, and fear-mongering or finger-pointing helps no one.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"why-this-is-important-to-me\" href=\"#why-this-is-important-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Why This Is Important to Me\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"those-closest-to-me\" href=\"#those-closest-to-me\">\n  </a>\n  Those Closest to Me\n</h3>\n\n<p>I grew up with someone in my household who had an untreated mental health condition. It wasn‚Äôt schizophrenia, but it deeply shaped my world from my earliest memories. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù - it was simply normal for me. Years later, after I was grown, they finally received help. I wish I could say it was a storybook turnaround. There were good stretches, and some not-so-good ones. Did all those years without support play a role in how things are now? I can‚Äôt say for sure - but I know it didn‚Äôt help.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"my-own-journey\" href=\"#my-own-journey\">\n  </a>\n  My Own Journey\n</h3>\n\n<p>I was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition in my early twenties (and I‚Äôm always willing to talk about it privately if anyone needs support - just reach out). Honestly, I felt ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù long before I ever got the diagnosis. I couldn‚Äôt quite name it, and for a long time I just assumed I was ‚Äúoff‚Äù in some way. Admitting there might be a problem took a <em>long</em> time; actually seeking help took <em>even longer</em> and was often inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until college, when I signed up for free counseling sessions (for reasons I can‚Äôt even remember - probably thanks to a sibling who worked in the office), that things started to shift. My counselor, Maggie, was the definition of approachable and probably saved my life more than once. One of the first things she did was encourage more frequent sessions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A quick PSA:</strong> Finding the right counselor or therapist can be pure luck - or it can take a lot of searching. If you tried once and it didn‚Äôt click, don‚Äôt give up. Your ‚ÄúMaggie‚Äù is out there, but you‚Äôll never meet them if you don‚Äôt keep looking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with counseling for a long time (in addition to other treatment). Life eventually took us in different directions, and it hasn‚Äôt always been as easy since, but I learned how to show up for myself and talk about it. Some days I‚Äôm better at it than others, but overall, I‚Äôm a happy, healthy adult - and, most importantly, I finally <em>feel</em> normal.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"ripple-effects\" href=\"#ripple-effects\">\n  </a>\n  Ripple Effects\n</h3>\n\n<p>Out of respect for my family‚Äôs privacy, I won‚Äôt go deep here. But as an adult, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how mental health issues can affect not just individuals, but entire families - even those who don‚Äôt live under the same roof. The big lesson: it‚Äôs not just okay to talk about mental health and seek help - <strong>it‚Äôs essential</strong>. The person in my life who struggled is doing much better now, thanks to a treatment plan that worked for them and continued care.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\" href=\"#be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health\">\n  </a>\n  Be Part of the Solution to Mental Health\n</h2>\n\n<p>Mental health struggles - crisis or not - are <em>never</em> caused by one thing, and they‚Äôre never solved by one thing. It takes understanding, openness, and the willingness to address tough topics. Spreading rumors or horror stories like ‚ÄúChatGPT made her crazy!‚Äù only hurts people who are already suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please, be part of the solution. Share. Talk. Show up.

Typically, the draft version is roughly twice as long as the final version and my posts aren‚Äôt exactly short to begin with (I know).</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>THREE. <strong>Edits</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this is where it gets a <em>little tricky</em>. I have a custom set of instructions for the blog posts, in which the majority of it is focused on two major things, in order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Scan the entire post and make changes wherever needed to remove <strong>unintentional bias</strong>, and for every change you make, summarize it with examples and <strong>show me</strong> why your version is better suited. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm getting better as we go, but it‚Äôs really just a safety net so I don‚Äôt accidentally put my foot in my mouth after taking the scenic route to my point (it‚Äôs a talent).  üì∏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep my <strong>original attitude and quirks</strong> as much as possible, but not to the extent that it contradicts the first point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I already trained it a long time ago to censor me. It doesn‚Äôt even bring that part up anymore, most of the time anyway. üò∂ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FOUR. <strong>Negotiation</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really don‚Äôt have a better word for what happens during this phase, because that‚Äôs exactly what it feels like. ChatGPT took my nice story and turned it into something that I only vaguely recognize, so I‚Äôll argue that it‚Äôs <em>TOO</em> changed. </p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT argues with me that not everybody understands what a \"holler\" is and that it‚Äôs probably already too far off-topic to explain whatever contextual point I wanted to make anyway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's usually accurate, too. üò§</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>FIVE. <strong>Final polish</strong></p>\n\n<p>After we have a <em>final working version</em> (cause I‚Äôm still changing it randomly), the quizzing starts for all those words I want to say, but really just cannot put my finger on or I need to convey some sort of emotion or attitude (and I‚Äôm getting sick of seeing the same emojis all the time).</p>\n\n<p>This is where the content of the blog conversation in ChatGPT pivots and I‚Äôll have it show me a random 10 emojis that could work for a particular phrase or scenario - I‚Äôll pick from there. Same with section titles and quotes, too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>üíø When it comes to titles, quotes, and references - it's rarely as simple as <strong>picking one</strong> from a list. Most of the time, I'll pick parts of at least three and then feed them back to ChatGPT to make coherent again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>SIX. <strong>Final review</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this point it‚Äôs all loaded into Dev, but I'm still reviewing repeatedly until I can make it from top to bottom without the urge to change something immediately (which can sometimes take a couple days - like this post ‚ö°Ô∏è). </p>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs typically a whole lot of page swapping (preview &gt; edit &gt; preview) until I‚Äôm finally happy with the overall version.

This is the AI-generated section, after all.

Well, the adult me understood. The stubborn side? Not so much. (I could write a whole other post on the wild stuff I came up with to get access to that feature, but I‚Äôll spare you.)</p>\n\n<p>So, I gave myself an ultimatum:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Outright buy the license (no, on principle)</li>\n<li>Admit defeat and move on (it physically hurt)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I <em>tried</em> to move on - <em>really tried</em>. I picked up a code review tool project to distract myself, hoping that maybe - just maybe - someone (anyone) would change their mind.

By now, I‚Äôd spent a solid month perfecting every edge case in Copilot‚Äôs prompts and instructions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Confidence level:</strong> dangerous üìõ<br>\n<strong>Caution level:</strong> hovering slightly above zero üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name=\"the-incident\" href=\"#the-incident\">\n  </a>\n  The Incident\n</h2>\n\n<p>Naturally, I decided it was time to get bold - <strong>recklessly bold</strong>.<br>\nAt first, all the action was inside Codespaces: safe, disposable, nuke-it-and-move-on territory. Controlled chaos. </p>\n\n<p>But then I had my ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù idea: let‚Äôs see what happens if I let Copilot off-leash in VS Code Insiders, with blanket auto-approvals across the board. I'm not just talking about the auto-approve CLI command, either.  I checked <em>all</em> the boxes - extensions, commits, MCP Jira/Confluence - and sat back and watched the fun unfold.</p>\n\n<p>Think: duct-taping a claymore to your Roomba, blasting ‚ÄúWelcome to the Jungle,‚Äù and shouting ‚ÄúIntruder alert!‚Äù at your cat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ü™Ñ If you missed the all-time funniest Facebook surprise from 2019, here‚Äôs a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@less_stolen/video/7214934775834987782\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TikTok version</a>.

I could practically smell the productivity.</p>\n\n<p>And then - well, you know where this is going - I stepped away. I swear it was just for a snack. Copilot was on a roll, and I was starving. In those ‚Äúprobably more than five, but definitely not ten‚Äù minutes I was gone (less than half the time of a normal task at that point), Copilot... <em>noticed</em>.

It was like watching an octopus try to do synchronized swimming! ü¶ë</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could I have made a bigger mess if I‚Äôd tried?

Prompt it with something like:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight markdown\"><code>Given requirements in JIRA-123, analyze #codebase and propose 3 implementation options with pros/cons.

This is also the perfect time to validate your setup, including the story itself and custom instructions. Ask yourself, is the result what you expected it to be? If not, can you pinpoint which detail was unclear or too complex?</p>\n\n<p>This is not only a great time to improve your custom instructions and story definition, but also explore alternative approaches.

The more straightforward the prompt and instructions are, the less room Copilot has to veer off its intended path or hallucinate a better implementation than the one you had planned. </p>\n\n<p>Your prompt should include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Specific <code>#file</code> or <code>#selection</code> that is relevant to the task</li>\n<li>Open any related or secondary files in the editor as additional context</li>\n<li>A numbered list of implementation steps, if you need better control or visibility along the way.</li>\n<li>Specify any important design patterns, security concerns, or future work planned (can also be separate <code>.github/instructions/specific-guidelines.instruction.md</code> files in the repo for ultimate reusability.</li>\n<li>Identify any important config files (like <code>./eslint.config.js</code> or <code>./vitest.config.js</code>) that Copilot must adhere to and put them in context with #file.</li>\n<li>For complex tasks, add an extra step instructing Copilot to consider at least X alternative approaches before starting work. Assess whether the detailed implementation plan covers all edge cases and error scenarios appropriately. If not, then update accordingly before moving on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It's always better to be more specific and more strict than to provide no guidance at all. If that means your prompt is closer to the size of a 3-page essay, then that's OK! Try it out and make changes later, if needed.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name=\"example-prompt\" href=\"#example-prompt\">\n  </a>\n  ‚ÄºÔ∏è Example prompt:\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight
