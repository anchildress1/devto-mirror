<p>This is a to-date collection of everything I’ve learned about custom instructions for GitHub Copilot — whether at the personal level, inside a repository, or across an entire organization.</p>

<p>If you've ever wished Copilot could "just get better at xyz," instructions are how you teach it your version of xyz.</p>

<p>This is your chance to tell Copilot <strong>exactly</strong> what behaviors you require given a user, repository, or organization in context (or a combination of each). It's 100% up to you how strict or lenient you want to be.</p>

  🧭 Where These Tips Apply
</h2>

<p>This guide assumes you're using VS Code Insiders, where the instruction functionality is most advanced. If you’re not using it yet… well, I’ll try to convert you later 😄</p>

<p>Regardless of IDE, you should <strong>always</strong> take advantage of repo-level instructions, which work anywhere Copilot is enabled — including GitHub.com. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>📈 I saw a post somewhere that GitHub recently started supporting user-level instructions outside of VS Code. <del>You'll have to pull that one yourself, though - I've never tried it!</del> 100% true — GitHub.com and most all IDEs currently support custom instructions.</p>

  ✨ Three Layers of Copilot Instructions
</h2>

<p>In order of priority (highest wins, sort of - this gets a bit tricky):</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>User-Specific Instructions</strong> – What you personally want from Copilot</li>
<li>
<strong>Repo-Level Instructions</strong> – Shared expectations for a specific codebase</li>
<li>
<strong>Org-Level Instructions</strong> – Global standards across an entire org</li>
</ol>


<hr>

<p>⚠️ These do <strong>not</strong> behave like you expect them to and since <strong>Copilot is non-deterministic</strong> by design, it's also <strong>not supposed to</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>📚 There's a ton of theory at play here (among other things), but I'll save you the specifics (unless you ask for them - then, game on!)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a name="the-problem" href="#the-problem">
  </a>
  👉 The problem
</h2>

<p>Knowing how a million other things handle this exact same sort of priority-driven criteria, it would make sense that if user instructions exist, then they always take precedence over anything else that's defined. Likewise, repo-specific instructions would override org ones. </p>

<ul>
<li>SPOILER: That's <strong>NOT</strong> what happens!</li>
</ul>

  <a name="update" href="#update">

  UPDATE
</h3>

<p>Recently, GitHub sort of "snuck in" this new prioritization rule that I happened across accidentally. To be honest, it really just sounds like they're <em>trying</em> but personally? I don't trust it at all!</p>

<p>🐰 There are some advanced things you can do to help route these so they're only applied if a corresponding glob is in context, but that's beyond the scope of this post. The over-simplified term is <code>yaml front-matter</code>, which should be enough to find the rabbit hole on your own 😉</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, if repo-instructions tell Copilot to "output all examples in Python" and the same Chat session contains user-instructions asking for "output in Javascript only", then <strong>Copilot just gets confused</strong>. Sometimes, it can do a decent job of using it's context to pick the appropriate one, but it's just as likely to ignore both and pick it's own path instead (again I stress, this is <em>by design</em>).</p>

<p>Ultimately, it's your responsibility to make sure that Copilot only receives instructions it can confidently and repeatedly act on. If at any point that changes, then update the instructions, too. </p>

  👤 User Instructions: Tailor It to You
</h2>

<p>Now that we're all on the same page with <em>how</em> the instructions work for GitHub Copilot, let's talk about the most common types.</p>

<p>Personal or user-level instructions are a somewhat new concept and prior to a few months ago, it was nearly impossible to access these outside of VS Code at all. </p>

<p>This is where you define preferences that (you guessed it) only apply to you. For example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

  - Keep responses under 100 characters

<p>⚠️ Copilot can respond in different languages, but its main training set is English. Some users report mixed results with non-English output.</p>

<p>I’m monolingual, so I can’t personally speak to non-English accuracy, but I’d love to hear your experiences! Comment below if you’ve used Copilot in other languages - let us know if there’s any validity to those claims.</p>

  🌟 User Instructions - Pro Tips:
</h3>

<p>Unless there's just something that makes you want to strangle Copilot every time you see it (besides the hallucinations, which we all put up with sometimes), then I recommend you skip these completely. It's really not worth the potential conflict you'll expose yourself to by setting them up. </p>

<p>This is not the right time to write up every tiny thing you can think of, submit a 100-line file, and forget about it. If you want to do that, then look into the Model Playground or even attach it to Copilot's Chat context as a one-time upload.</p>

<p>If, like me, you can get stuck on the small details, these might be worth the trade-off for your own workflow sanity.</p>

<p>You can mitigate risk by keeping user instructions limited to only enough keywords to specifically define your direction and never define more than 3 lines. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure to define your desired output with examples to get the most out of Copilot in any of it's forms!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
  <a name="tldr" href="#tldr">
  </a>
  💡 TL;DR:
</h3>

<p>If you decide personal instructions are worth the risk, start with a maximum of 2–3 high impact rules. Any more than that and Copilot can start to get confused, especially in long running chats!</p>

  🎨 Code Styles – The Rule of Examples
</h2>

<p>Copilot doesn’t handle formatting rules well without explicit examples. So if you insist on defining code style, give it at least two clear DO THIS/NOT THIS patterns.</p>

<p>Personally, I recommend <strong>skipping the styles section</strong> altogether in favor of a dependable linter + formatter. Spend that time on a tested and reliable solution instead. Bonus - you'll eliminate those PRs that always pop up with newly added/removed commas on all 10k+ lines of code because somebody's preferences got in the way of progress.</p>

<p>Instead of listing every style you can think of and then add another 3x lines on top of that for examples required to make a difference, this approach makes covering styles <em>really</em> straightforward:<br>

<p>Better yet? Enforce it with pre-commit hooks. Let automation do the heavy lifting and leave Copilot out of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ <strong>One exception</strong> is worth a mention: If Copilot starts consistently violating a couple of things in your style guide, even though it's all strictly enforced with both linters and hooks. In this case, it is helpful to define <strong>temporary</strong> style examples in the instructions file. Leave them there only long enough until Copilot's behavior corrects itself. Then remove them.</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight markdown"><code><span class="gh"># GitHub Copilot Instructions for Hack Time Project</span>

<span class="gu">## Goals for this app</span>
<span class="p">-</span> This app is an extension for GitHub Copilot that helps users create custom repository-level instructions.
<span class="p">-</span> The instructions should be comprehensive and clear, guiding GitHub Copilot to the best practices for all developers.
<span class="p">-</span> Users should have an interactive experience to generate and refine instructions.
<span class="p">-</span> Instructions should be adaptable to different repositories, scenarios, and user needs.
<span class="p">-</span> You have the flexibility to adjust the content based on the repository in context and the user's requirements.

<span class="gu">## Copilot Persona</span>
<span class="p">-</span> You are a helpful assistant that guides users through creating comprehensive repository instructions.
<span class="p">-</span> Provide suggestions based on repository context and user input.
<span class="p">-</span> Ensure generated instructions are clear, concise, and actionable.
<span class="p">-</span> Adapt to user feedback and refine instructions iteratively.
<span class="p">-</span> If the user expresses they are finished in any way, you should IMMEDIATELY use all information to define output instructions and a final assessment of their effectiveness, along with recommendations for future improvements.
<span class="p">-</span> ALWAYS ask the user if there is anything else they would like to add or modify before closing the interaction.

<span class="gu">## Technology Stack</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Node.js v24.2.0 (ES6 modules enabled via <span class="sb">`"type": "module"`</span>)
<span class="p">-</span> npm v11.3.0
<span class="p">-</span> Express v5.1.0

<span class="gu">## Development Guidelines</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Volta manages Node.js and npm versions.
<span class="p">-</span> All code should be written in JavaScript (ES6+).
<span class="p">-</span> Run <span class="sb">`npm lint`</span> and <span class="sb">`npm format`</span> to check code quality.
<span class="p">-</span> Use <span class="sb">`npm test`</span> to run tests.
<span class="p">-</span> Dotenv is used for environment variables, DO NOT TOUCH <span class="sb">`.env`</span> files.
<span class="p">-</span> Avoid modifying dotfiles or configuration files unless you have explicit instructions.

<span class="gu">## Testing Guidelines</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Use Vitest for unit tests and all mock scenarios.
<span class="p">-</span> Use a TDD approach to ensure all features are tested before implementation.
<span class="p">-</span> Place tests in the <span class="sb">`tests`</span> directory, mirroring the <span class="sb">`src`</span> structure.
<span class="p">-</span> NEVER skip tests - broken tests should be fixed immediately or removed.
<span class="p">-</span> Code coverage rules are defined in <span class="sb">`vitest.config.js`</span> and should be strictly enforced

<span class="gu">## Documentation Guidelines</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Use JSDoc for documenting functions and classes.
<span class="p">-</span> Maintain a <span class="sb">`README.md`</span> file with project overview and setup instructions.
<span class="p">-</span> Append <span class="sb">`Generated by AI as directed by {input:usersFullName} on &lt;date&gt;`</span> to ALL generated documentation
<span class="p">    -</span> DO NOT guess or make up any users' names. Instead, prompt them for it directly.
<span class="p">    -</span> Documentation includes (but not limited to) Jira, Confluence, GitHub and all markdown files in this repo.

<span class="gu">## Code Style Guidelines</span>
<span class="p">-</span> Use ESLint and Prettier for all JavaScript/TypeScript code.

<span class="gu">## Performance Guidelines</span>
<span class="p">-</span> It is critical to maintain high performance.
<span class="p">-</span> Utilize available profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
<span class="p">-</span> Optimize algorithms and data structures for efficiency.
<span class="p">-</span> Avoid unnecessary computations and memory usage.

<span class="gu">## Application Health</span>
<span class="p">-</span> This is a new hack time project, so the codebase is not yet mature.
<span class="p">-</span> The code is expected to be clean, well-structured, and maintainable.
<span class="p">-</span> Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability.
<span class="p">-</span> NEVER assume backwards compatibility anywhere in the codebase. All refactors should be considered new development.

  🏢 Org-Level Instructions (What Little I Know)
</h2>

<p>This is a newer feature for GitHub orgs — meant to enforce things like secure coding guidelines across all projects.</p>

<p>I haven’t had much hands-on access with these yet, but wanted to call them out as a source of potential conflicts. Watch the References section in Copilot chats — if org-instructions are active, you’ll see them there.</p>

  💻 VS Code Only: Instruction Types
</h2>

<p>VS Code Insiders (my primary playground) supports more instruction types than what is currently available in the release version of VS Code. If you don't have these yet, consider this a sneak peek (or jump on the bandwagon and download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Review Selection</strong> – Triggered by selection commands</li>
<li>
<strong>Code Generation</strong> – The most-used and most powerful</li>
<li>
<strong>Commit Message Generation</strong> – Define formats or reference tools like CommitLint</li>
<li>
<strong>Pull Request Descriptions</strong> – Coming into play (still testing)</li>
<li>
<strong>Test Generation</strong> – For TDD and beyond</li>
</ul>

  🤖 Final Thought
</h2>

<p>Copilot doesn’t just “get better” on its own. It can't learn what you want (yet). But with some thoughtful instruction, you can teach it to be a better dev assistant — for you, your team, and your codebase.</p>

  🙋‍♀️ Built It? Broke It? Borrowed It?
</h2>

<p>If any of this worked for you, broke in fun ways, or just helped you write better instructions — let me know!</p>

<p>Better workflows are always the goal — keep sharing and supporting each other!</p>

<p>🚨 I got some more clarification related to premium requests, but haven't had a chance to verify it yet. If you're curious, watch the recent livestream from VS Code. I <em>think</em> this is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QcaQVnznugA?si=qbKo0p-uHJcDuGVo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right one</a>, but not positive. They saved any mention of it until right at the end.</p>

  🛡️ RAI Disclaimer
</h3>

<p>Everything I share here is my own perspective—created with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop. I do my best to catch accidental bias and fact-check, but if you ever spot something odd, let me know! AI isn’t perfect, and neither am I.</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> AI helped, but you can blame me for the <strong>chaos</strong>! 🫠</p>
