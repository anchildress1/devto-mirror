  <article><blockquote>
<p>🦄 I feel like I have some serious catching up to do with Copilot, especially after the ginormous number of updates sprinkled over quite literally everything. The latest model releases weren’t helping matters either, especially since I wrote most of my global user setup months ago and this latest generation of LLMs do not behave the same way as the last batch did.</p>

<p>At some point it became obvious that my “it mostly works” setup wasn’t actually holding up across systems anymore — and if I was already going to normalize things, I might as well write down what I was doing while it was still fresh.</p>

<p>What I did <em>not</em> intend to do, however, was write this post. Honestly, the thought never crossed my mind until I looked up and it was already more than halfway written. Which I obviously took as a sign of some sort—though it’s just as likely muscle memory combined with my tendency to overshare. 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>Either way, hopefully someone finds it useful. Repurpose it, steal pieces of it, or ignore it entirely—and if you’ve got something I haven’t thought of yet, I want to hear about it. That’s how systems get better! 🪢</p>

  <a href="#ai-is-not-a-magician">
  </a>
  AI Is Not a Magician 🪄
</h2>

<p>Bear with me through our baseline here—everything that follows depends on understanding this distinction first.</p>

<p>I jump into so many random debates—usually uninvited—about the ultimate usefulness of AI and nearly every single argument I hear about AI behaving badly gets the exact same reply from me: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Of course</em> it torched your entire repo—and probably in record time! You just let an unsupervised mostly unhinged guessing machine loose with a flamethrower, blanket auto-approvals, and admin-level control. 🔥🐉🤯</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand why that keeps happening, you have to understand the difference between what we casually call “AI” and the large language model (LLM) underneath it. These are not the same thing and shouldn’t be treated like they are.</p>

<p>Every LLM is stateless by design, meaning every call you make is a clean slate. You give it input and it outputs a response. Conceptually, it's no different than an HTTP call—except instead of returning a standardized value with a predictable schema, the LLM returns something more... <em>creative</em>.</p>

<p>The AI system sitting on top of that model is what makes everything <em>feel</em> connected. That's the system deciding what context to attach, what history to include, and how to frame every request so the LLM has any chance of responding in a useful way. If the AI fails at managing that data, the LLM never stood a chance to begin with.</p>

<p>Last I heard, GitHub supports something like 180 million users. If I guess and say 80% of them use Copilot, that’s 144 million different user workflows—and therefore 144 million competing definitions of what a “good” response looks like.</p>

<p><strong>It is not designed to magically work out of the box</strong>—especially in production codebases—no matter how much they'd like you to believe otherwise!</p>

  <a href="#instructions-are-a-priority-stack">
  </a>
  Instructions Are a Priority Stack 🧱
</h2>

<p>One of the very first posts I wrote—which honestly deserves an update—was about setting up <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/all-ive-learned-about-github-copilot-instructions-so-far-5bm7">custom repo instructions</a>. There’s no shortage of instruction-writing advice floating around out there, and there's just as many opinions about the “right” way to do it.</p>

<p>I'm not even remotely invested in that particular debate—<em>I know</em>, I was shocked, too!—I do know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that if you expect AI to play by your rules, then you first have to explicitly tell it what those rules are.</p>

<p>I will say it again: <strong>AI is not a coding magician</strong>. It’s also not a particularly great guesser. The system instructions in VS Code do a decent job of orienting the model toward the idea that "you write code", but they're also intentionally generic so it works for everyone. </p>

<p>Here’s a snippet so you can see what I mean:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre><code>You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.

When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1. 

Follow the user's requirements carefully &amp; to the letter.

Keep your answers short and impersonal.

You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.

The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly.

You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like <span class="sb">`/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`</span>. 

If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.

If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
</code></pre>

</div>


<blockquote>
<p>🦄 I absolutely picked through these and kept only the interesting bits. If you want the full thing, run <code>Developer: Show Chat Debug View</code> and you can see exactly what Copilot sends with every request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full set of system instructions includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>JSON for every enabled tool</li>
<li>well over a hundred lines of system instructions</li>
<li>all global user instructions</li>
<li>all applicable repo instruction paths</li>
<li>custom agent names and metadata</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The ordering matters.</strong> LLMs will start summarizing aggressively after processing the first chunk of input. If something matters, put it where it’s least likely to be compressed. The data volume matters too—more text usually means more summarization, not more intelligence.</p>

<p>And if you introduce instructions that directly conflict with the system-level ones, the results don’t get better. They get progressively worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 Telling AI it's an "expert coder" is largely unnecessary. One: because that's already been done for you by the system. Two: experience—and a healthy side of gut instinct—tells me those "expert" statements are doing more harm than good. Personally, I stopped using any variant of the "expert" statement a long time ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#this-is-my-baseline-not-a-blueprint">
  </a>
  This Is My Baseline, Not a Blueprint 📐
</h2>

<p>People ask me why “my AI” works consistently, and the answer is always some version of: because I learned how to write instructions and adapt them to a version the system can reliably manage.</p>

<p>This is my personal baseline. These instructions reflect my hardware, workflows, tool choices, and even the personality adjustment is designed specifically to avoid my instant-rage trigger during long pairing sessions. Copilot is my primary use case, but these rules are wired everywhere I work and I use them <strong>in real projects</strong>.</p>

<p>This is definitely not the GitHub-marketing version of AI that exists to flatter the user. I gave it strict boundaries and strong opinions on purpose. I <em>want</em> pushback. I want the dry witty humor baked in. And I especially want the “are you serious?” responses that will snap me back to reality any time I start to veer down a tangent path.</p>

<p>In practice, Copilot waters that down way more than I’d like. So, perfecting this personality is going to be a work in progress for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>If you still want a copy after all the flashing warning signs, then there's a link in the README—help yourself 🫴</p>

  Trust Is Earned, Validation Is Mandatory 🧪
</h2>

<p>Whenever AI touches code—whether it’s a new feature or a quick fix—the results have to pass a specific set of checks <strong>before</strong> anything is presented to me in chat.</p>

<p>Not every repo is identical, so I've started using a Makefile in all of my personal projects. That gives AI a single, explicit definition of what “validation” means. Without that, it will go looking for standards on its own—and when it inevitably can’t find them, it guesses. My instructions make that behavior explicit so it defaults to the simplest path instead of inventing a new maze of random bash scripts just to run a missing lint command. 🙄</p>

<p>Note that there’s nothing remotely deterministic about asking any AI agent to run its own validations. Do not expect perfection every turn—you will be disappointed! The real solution requires more system-level support than is currently available, though. </p>

<p>This setup is my <strong>temporary placeholder</strong> for the smart agent system that ultimately <em>just works</em>. We’ll get there—eventually. In the meantime, this helps:<br>

  Kill the Default Personality 🔪
</h2>

<p>The very first thing I do with any new system is kill off the default “helpful” personality. If I wanted a behavioral therapist to tell me how great I am, I wouldn’t be writing software every day. It only takes one “You’re absolutely right!” response for me to be done with the niceties—and that’s still one too many!</p>

<p>I also don’t want a play-by-play of which files were updated or a long explanation of how the solution was reached. If I didn’t explicitly ask, then I genuinely do not care. The moment a small essay starts forming in chat, I’m out—the IDE gets minimized and I just wait for it to finish embarrassing itself. I’m not reading past the last few lines, and I’ve absolutely burned more than one prompt asking a different model to summarize the response into something I might actually comprehend.</p>

<p>My go-to AI personality is not designed for the easily offended or for anyone in a “trying to learn something new” headspace. Instead, it does this:<br>

  Leave Git Alone—It Belongs to Me 🔐
</h2>

<p>I do occasionally throw AI the keys and sit back just to see which fireworks fly and where the system cracks. Those repos are set up as explicit experiments and designed for that purpose from the start—it’s <em>never</em> the baseline.</p>

<p>In my normal workflows, AI is leashed far away from anything that writes to either Git or GitHub. Inside the IDE, source control staging is my truth for code I’ve already reviewed. The moment Copilot adds to it, I'm no longer certain of what was reviewed versus not, which means starting over.</p>

<p>I do everything I can to keep Git history pristine, which means AI doesn’t touch it beyond read-only commands or research in external repos. The <code>--no-pager</code> rule is a bonus I added after AI kept getting stuck waiting for input any time it tried to view a diff.<br>

  Config Has Boundaries, Too 🚧
</h2>

<p>AI does not touch my repo configuration without explicit authorization. <em>Ever</em>. This is a direct extension of my ongoing mission to eliminate every <code>// eslint-disable-next-line</code> that’s ever been tossed into a repo just to force a green check. More importantly, it prevents AI from quietly reproducing the exact patterns I’m trying to get rid of in the first place.</p>

<p>If a config change would genuinely help—and isn’t being used to paper over a failure—AI is expected to surface the suggestion clearly in chat. That way, my formatters and linters don’t become useless because all the rules were disabled while I wasn’t paying attention.<br>

<p>Some of these instructions are intentionally written to counteract specific, ultra-annoying AI tendencies—like curbing Claude’s occasional bout of what I can only describe as “excessive compulsive disorder.”</p>

<p>Most of what I build is either a toy or a dev utility. If something changes, then it changes. I have zero interest in complicating otherwise clean systems with backwards compatibility—especially when the only user is me.</p>

<p>I’m also deeply addicted to automation, even when the only real payoff is perfectly numbered releases starting from zero. Breaking changes are recorded accurately in commits using a reusable AI prompt (also in my <a href="https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome-github-copilot repo</a>). Release-please watches <code>main</code>, handles the semver bump on merge, and generates a changelog tied to an immutable GitHub release.</p>

  Docs Are a Tool, Not a Diary ✍️
</h2>

<p>Documentation exists to be useful. The problem is that nobody ever defined what “useful” means for the AI that’s now writing it. And what does AI do when it doesn’t have a clear answer? It guesses—and it usually guesses that you wanted <em>everything</em> documented from <em>every</em> possible angle across the entire codebase.</p>

<p><strong>Spoiler</strong>: that’s never actually helpful.</p>

<p>On top of that, I’m convinced most of us are conditioned to ignore even the best-written docs by default. <em>Don’t believe me?</em> When was the last time you were asked an extremely technical question and your first thought was, “I bet that’s accurate, up-to-date, and easy to find in the documentation”? 🤷‍♀️</p>

<p>Which leaves exactly zero reasons to let AI free-style pages of prose for fun. Instead, you have to tell it what documentation is <em>for</em>:<br>

<p>Copilot’s default instructions list every enabled tool in your workspace, but that list has nothing to do with how I actually expect work to be done. This section exists to define expectations and constraints for execution, not to mirror Copilot’s internal tool inventory.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> define this entirely at the repo level—and these rules are intentionally written to allow that—but I’m also spinning up new repos all the time. Having a baseline gives me a predictable starting point and a clear target state. It also ensures that code written against, say, Node v18 doesn’t quietly diverge from a default target of v24.</p>
