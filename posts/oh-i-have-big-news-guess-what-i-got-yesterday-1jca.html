<hr>

<p>Okay, technically, I’ve known this was coming for a while, and honestly, I’ve felt ready even longer than that. Yes, I celebrated with a gift Leonardo subscription to myself. (I’ll be way more excited about it once those 429 errors slow down enough for me to actually play with it again.) </p>

<p>Seriously — if you’re even considering Leonardo: it’s exploding right now, but if you’re like me (dev brain: ‘ooh, code banners!’), know that Leonardo is <em>pure artist</em>. Artists and devs? Different planets, sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🎨 The first time I tossed it a dev prompt: “I need a banner image representing a group of diverse engineers upgrading Java with Copilot.” I expected... I dunno, coffee? Maybe a way-too-big wrench? Instead: <strong>FOUR wildly different, amazing steampunk apocalypse scenes with a diverse squad running away from a tank the size of a data center.</strong> 🤣</p>

<p>Yes, Leonardo — sometimes I <em>do</em> feel like that with Java, but it wasn’t exactly what I had in mind! Still, totally worth it just to immortalize Java as the official steampunk language. 🚂⚙️</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But let’s set art aside, because:</p>

<p><strong>I did it! I am now officially GitHub Copilot certified!</strong> 🫶</p>

<p>This one’s been on my list <em>forever</em>, but once Microsoft announced their plan to switch everything to Pearson VUE, I gave it a month before risking the “please excuse our growing pains” phase. So, here we are!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> They’re still ironing out the kinks. The test itself? Needs work, but passable. The VUE app? Good, even though they made me download it twice, because why not. 🤷‍♀️</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#tldr">
  </a>
  TL;DR
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pearson Vue online process:</strong> Better than expected! (Not 100% bug-free, but not a disaster.) 👍</li>
<li>
<strong>O’Reilly Copilot prep course:</strong> Absolutely worth it (and also pointed out all the places I thought I knew but really needed to revisit) 📚</li>
<li>
<strong>Giving them a month to get their act together?</strong> LOL. Nope. Not nearly enough to fix all the quirks between the doc and real life. ⏳</li>
<li>
<strong>I’ll follow up soon</strong> with an actual step-by-step for anyone prepping for the GitHub Copilot Certification exam (spoiler: bring snacks — you’ll be reading a lot of documentation!) 🍿📝</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  <a href="#testing-signup-amp-study-materials">
  </a>
  Testing Signup &amp; Study Materials 🖥️📄
</h2>

<p>I signed up via Microsoft Learn (work perk!). The sign-up process was so simple I forgot it even happened. Then I intentionally ignored the looming test until the last second — do not recommend, unless you’re also a chronic Copilot abuser (also not recommended!)</p>

<p>Microsoft will port you to Pearson VUE for the real process. Pro tip: for <em>THIS</em> step, do whatever Microsoft tells you. (Only this step. Later? All bets are off.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Super important:</strong> If you use a work/corporate Microsoft account, also link your personal one! You’ll still get work discounts, but your certification stays with you — not the company. Seriously, you do NOT want to have to re-earn this badge if you switch jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re testing online: Read Pearson’s test space policy. You need an enclosed room, one monitor/laptop, and 3 hours of zero interruptions. Those “bathroom test” legends? No longer allowed. No refunds either if you try it and get booted.</p>


<hr>

<h2>
  <a href="#do-the-certification-prep-study">
  </a>
  Do the Certification Prep + Study! 📚💡
</h2>

<p>First thing — take a prep course! I went with <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/github-copilot-certification-crash-course/0642572013405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Warner’s at O’Reilly</a> (another work perk!)</p>

<p>I expected it to be a snoozefest but nope, it’s actually engaging, and the group vibe is fun. Their class dashboard is super flexible, so get comfy for 4+ hours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> the recordings can take up to 2 days <em>after</em> the class, so if you miss part of it, you can’t just catch up right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>

  Bonus drama 🧠
</h3>

<p>This is also where I learned about “brain dump” practice tests. Some (like a few on Udemy) get flagged for stolen content, and if you use those, Microsoft can yank your cert <strong>for life</strong>. Not my rabbit hole, but if anyone has the actual “offenders” list, drop a link in the comments!</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#day-before-the-test">
  </a>
  Day Before the Test 🕰️🛠️
</h2>

<p>Picture this: 10pm, my calendar looks more like a merge conflict than any form of organization, and I’ve just spent a half-day in a prep class (which was great, but just pointed out all the things I <em>thought</em> I knew and needed to go double-check). </p>

<p>Then there's my test space setup: I’m crammed into the tiniest corner of my house — the only space far enough from everyone else, where I can shut the door and (hopefully) not be interrupted. My not-quite-center desk barely fits, squeezed between the footboard and the wall, and there’s just enough room for me, my laptop, and a single can of Coke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that it was uncomfortable once I got myself situated, but any form of movement meant I was hitting something (mainly myself) on the desk or bed  🛏️💻🪑</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You won't want to wait until the last minute like I did, but also, there’s no need to set up a week early. The actual system test:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download zip &gt; Unzip &gt; Open &gt; Start.</li>
<li>Wait... spinner... okay, done.</li>
<li>Mic, sound, webcam. Check. </li>
<li>Internet + background system. Check.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t use your work computer unless you’re a full admin, with VPN OFF, and you can give <em>full system control</em> to the test app. Restart for a clean slate, and skip the “reopen windows” part. Paperwork? Nada. Until you actually check in. 🗂️</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The truth?</strong> My work laptop was more than fine. They stressed the point until I began to worry, but 0 issues. However, I get pretty much free reign with it. If your's is locked up tighter than admin? You could have issues!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#test-day">
  </a>
  Test Day 🎬😎
</h2>

<p>When you register, it defaults to an ungodly early time slot — but you can change it to what works for you. (Unless you are that <em><strong>weird morning person</strong></em> who's usually awake with the sun — you know who you are — just a friendly callout payback 😇).</p>

<h3>
  <a href="#signin">
  </a>
  Sign-In 🛎️🔑
</h3>

<p>You can sign in up to 30 minutes early. But the second you open that VUE test app, you’re stuck: no phone, no other apps, no moving. Meaning early birds get to wait longer; last-minute folks like me rush in, power nap, and join the waiting line just in time.</p>

<p>After everyone’s in the system:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download app (fresh), system test (again), green light.</li>
<li><strong>Scan your test space</strong></li>
<li>Begin exam</li>
</ol>


<hr>

<h3>
  <a href="#the-picture-game-my-desk-my-rules">
  </a>
  The Picture Game: My Desk, My Rules 🖼️🥤
</h3>

<p>Pearson wants 7 pictures, all from your phone:</p>

<ul>
<li>You, against a solid background. Easy. </li>
<li>ID, front and back, on a dark surface. Done.</li>
<li>Workspace: front, back, left, right...</li>
</ul>

<p>Insert where I made my first mistake — the Pearson Vue phone app lists strict instructions for <em>how</em> they want these pictures. They give you a little diagram to tell you exactly where they want you in relationship to the space when you snap the picture. I'm looking at it and studying... knowing good and well this is not going to work for what they want, but the rules said stand on X so I get as close to X as I can without acrobatics and snap the picture.</p>

<p>Next the "greeter" came online (these are the people responsible for making sure your test area meets all criteria for taking the online exam) and of course the pictures aren't clear enough. So we go through the whole “spin around” and show the whole room. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, it’s a live-action improv skit: me, my laptop, and the world’s smallest mouse trap of a space. Yes, Pearson, it's just a Coke. No, there’s nothing else hiding in here unless you count my dignity — which definitely disappeared between picture three and four. 🙈🫠</p>

  <a href="#exam-begins-more-dramatics-ensue-%F0%9F%AB%A3">
  </a>
  Exam Begins: More Dramatics Ensue 🫣🎭
</h3>

<p>Now that's out of the way, we can get down to business. <strong>Ready, set, go!</strong> Instructions pop up first (read them again). Timer (hide it if you want to stay sane). And Begin. ⏱️</p>

<p>I’m focused, in the zone — then, out of nowhere: <strong>Click. “Is there someone in the room with you?”</strong> Me, blinking at the screen: “No... Oh, wait, I was just talking to myself! I swear I never read a question ou–" Click. Chat window: “Continue the exam.” 😅</p>

<p>Well.. alright then. I guess we're good. Five minutes later — interrupted <strong>again</strong>: “If you don’t stop talking, I’ll cancel your exam.” <em>WHAT?!</em> “Okay! Not a problem — I'll stop." 🤐</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I really could have used a break. Microsoft policy explicitly allows unscheduled breaks (timer keeps running, can’t revisit earlier questions). But... I needed to review everything before submitting, so I just clammed up and finished. It was painful!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time the exam was over I'm super antsy — energy is boiling over from the long stretch of silence — but the only thing left is exactly 7 questions I've flagged for feedback to Microsoft (this is the only way you're allowed to mention anything about specific questions after the test is finished). Checked the timer — 20 minutes left — perfect! 🤗</p>

<p>I told the proctor, “I’m taking a quick break, answers are all submitted.” Stepped five feet away, and suddenly, a <em>new</em> proctor:<br>
“Hello? Are you there? You need to be in front of the camera!” Door open, I explained, “Just the restroom, all submitted!” “You can’t leave the view of the camera.” Well, I <em>know</em> they didn't want me to take the computer with me — so honestly, what did they want me to do? 😲</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Confession:</strong> I was so done with being polite at that point. I'm already jumping out of my skin from the roaring silence for more than an hour. Now even though Microsoft’s policy says unscheduled breaks are allowed at any point, I'm getting threatened for no reason I can discern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After three rounds of “You can’t leave!” with "But I'm already finished. It's just the feedback." I gave up. “Alright – fine! No feedback, then.” Click. Click. Done. ...Crickets. 🦗</p>

<p>I sat there, stunned. Camera turned off, grade popped up — yes, I passed, but <strong>seriously, <em>what just happened</em>?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later, I went digging and found a Microsoft blog post from 2022 that clearly shows: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>⏸️ Take a Break<code>&lt;/button&gt;</code><br>
Did my exam have a break button? NOPE. Well then, <em>THAT</em> explains it. 😑🙃</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#moral-of-the-story">
  </a>
  Moral of the Story 💬
</h2>

<p>I left a very thorough explanation in Pearson VUE’s feedback form. Yes, I was frustrated, but this isn’t about the proctors or the greeters — they were never rude. It’s either training, documentation, or both! </p>

<p>I wish my voice would have made it to Microsoft, because I had <em>plenty to say</em> about their process and I had spent precious time preparing to do so! Now I just hope the next person either gets that missing break button — or at least they update the docs!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would I do it again?</strong> Absolutely! Things happen. This is my dramatic version of events so you don’t have to repeat my mistakes (and hopefully had a little fun along the way). Besides — ultimately, I got exactly what I wanted when I started! 💞✨</p>
