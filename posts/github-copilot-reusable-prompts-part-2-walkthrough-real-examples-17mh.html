  <article><blockquote>
<p>Hey, welcome back 👋 If you haven't had a chance to read Part 1 introducing all of the different working parts of GitHub Copilot’s reusable prompts — <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-reusable-and-experimental-prompts-part-1-iff">check it out here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we jump in, ask yourself this: <strong>How well can you anticipate Copilot’s response to your prompts?</strong></p>

<p>If it still feels like a surprise every time, I seriously recommend setting aside 30 minutes to just <em>play</em>. You don’t need anything fancy — no reusable YAML, no multi-step wizardry. Just write a single chat message that covers everything needed to complete one task.</p>

<p>Do you need a brand new React component? Unit tests? Maybe your repository is two years behind on documentation (yeah... I’ve been there). Write a prompt for that!</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> you try — the real goal is to see if you can supply <strong>all the info Copilot needs</strong> to get the job done in one go.<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip</strong>: GPT models are <em>especially bad</em> at immediate execution. They’ll gather information, agree with your logic, maybe even summarize the steps perfectly... and then take no action at all. So, if you're struggling to get single-prompt execution working with the free version, it's most likely <strong>not</strong> you.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Feeling brave? Try your luck with <strong>Coding Agent</strong>. It’s a great way to test your prompting skills: how much information can you successfully feed Copilot at once? (I’ll get into all the quirks of Coding Agent in a future post — promise!)</p>

<p>Just know that reusable prompts are built on this same logic — a single message that defines <em>everything</em> needed to complete a task from start to finish.<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 Quick reminder: Copilot is 100% worth <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying out in Insiders</a>. IntelliJ still owns Java, no question — but you’re missing out on a lot of Copilot’s best tricks if you haven’t made the jump. 🫶</p>

  Reusable Prompts Overview 🧰
</h2>

<p>Quick recap from last week: A reusable prompt is a combination of an instruction (how to act) and a step-by-step guide. The prompt is driven by the YAML front matter, which optionally defines:</p>

<ol>
<li>the <strong>mode</strong> (<code>agent</code>, <code>edit</code>, <code>ask</code>)</li>
<li>which <strong>model</strong> (<code>GPT-4.1</code>, <code>Claude Sonnet 4</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>accessible <strong>tools</strong> (built-in, extensions, and MCP)</li>
<li>prompt <strong>description</strong> (for completeness)</li>
</ol>

<p>When specifying tools, be sure to follow the <em>principle of least privilege</em>. Use the fewest tools needed to get the job done — nothing more.<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip!</strong> Agent mode has access to tools, but the other modes do not. So if your prompt needs to read files, run shell commands, or write to disk, be sure to specify <code>mode: agent</code>.</p>

  Personal Guide to Prompting — <strong>PRIOR</strong> 🧭
</h2>

<p>Next, let’s cover one of my personal formulas for prompt engineering. And if you try to search for this or ask Gemini what “PRIOR” stands for, you're probably going to confuse it. Why? Because I made it up. But I promise you — it works!</p>

<p>At its core, it’s a remix of the well-known RICE formula (Role, Instructions, Context, and Examples). RICE didn’t cover everything I needed, so I added more. RICE-O didn’t really stick (honestly, all I could think of was Rice-A-Roni...), so I went back to the drawing board and gave ChatGPT a list of words and synonyms and said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I need an acronym I won’t forget — because it would be just like me to have a brilliant idea that could’ve made me a millionaire, and forget it by tomorrow morning."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, <strong>PRIOR</strong> was born — a simple checklist for designing prompts, reusable or otherwise.</p>

<p><br><br>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 I know — we really didn’t need <em>another</em> acronym or prompt strategy. I get it. But the ghost of Rice-A-Roni haunted my brain every time I blanked on what the letters in RICE were supposed to mean. So I made <em>PRIOR</em> instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For my non-American friends: 📦 <em>Rice-A-Roni</em> is a boxed rice-and-pasta side dish that’s been marketed to Americans since the 1950s as “The San Francisco Treat™.” It’s one of those nostalgic foods you grow up seeing in pantries... but never quite understand why.</p>

<p>In the early days, personas were often used like:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You are a senior principal engineer with 20 years of experience in C++.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It caught on like wildfire — everyone thought they were tapping into some hidden reserve of wisdom only a 20-year C++ veteran could offer. But what it really produced was the <em>confidence</em> of that engineer, not the <em>accuracy</em>. So we ended up with a flood of responses that weren’t just wrong — they were <strong>confidently wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>Is it realistic? Not really. Is it useful? Absolutely. The more engaging and unique the role, the more Copilot leans into it. Wild, weird, or whimsical — it doesn’t matter, as long as it’s <strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>plausible</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Bonus:</strong> It’s just more <em>FUN</em> this way. Try giving Copilot a totally off-the-wall persona — something weird, but still relevant to the task at hand. If it works (or breaks in a hilariously bad way), share your experiment below!</p>

<h3>
  <a name="requirements" href="#requirements">
  </a>
  Requirements ✅
</h3>

<p>Requirements are really just your <em>definition of done</em>. What does it look like when the prompt succeeds?</p>

<p>If we continue with the commit message example, the requirement could be as simple as:</p>

<p><code>Your goal is to output a valid commit message based on the current staged changes.</code></p>

<p><em>Voila</em> — done.</p>

<p>Of course, it could get more complex. Maybe you require a conventional commit format, or that it passes <code>commitlint</code>. That’s fine. Just say it clearly, and use <strong>action words</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🔌 Pretend you’re giving instructions to your 10-year-old who refuses to clean their room. You don’t say “Please can you help me tidy up now?” You say: “You MUST clean up this mess before I get back, or I swear I’ll unplug the internet and take the cord with me.”</p>

  Aside for ALLCAPS 🔠
</h4>

<p>I’m still not convinced ALLCAPS helps the AI much — but it <strong>does</strong> help <em>you</em>. Humans spot those key phrases easier when they stand out. So go ahead and use the usual suspects from the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IETF</a>: MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, MAY, ...and so on.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="impediments" href="#impediments">
  </a>
  Impediments 🧱
</h3>

<p>This is just a fancy way of saying: what can go wrong?</p>

<p>These are the critical blockers you want to <em>prevent ahead of time</em>. Impediments help shape the boundaries of your prompt, and again — ALLCAPS works great here.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Isolation</strong>: NEVER combine content from a previous <code>commit.tmp</code> file with a new commit message. ALWAYS start fresh.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Shortcuts</strong>: You MUST NOT skip any steps or rules. Every line in this prompt must be followed EXACTLY.</li>
<li>
<strong>Specification</strong>: Follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification EXACTLY</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  <a name="outcomes" href="#outcomes">
  </a>
  Outcomes 📤
</h3>

<p>If you don’t tell Copilot <em>exactly</em> what outcome you expect, you risk a whole world of "not what I meant."</p>

<p>Ask for a commit message, and it might do that <em>plus</em> push the branch, delete your fork, and wipe out staging. (If you missed the wildly dramatic retelling of <em>how I know</em>, <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-agent-mode-the-mistake-you-never-want-to-make-1mmh">you’ll find it here</a>.)</p>

<p>That’s where structured output helps. So spell it out. Want a file? Say that. Want it in the chat? Say that. Want both? Say <strong>that</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip</strong> Copilot performs better when you give it structure. Block off output in a code block (<code>json</code>, <code>bash</code>, <code>markdown</code>, etc.) and tell it what each section means. It helps Copilot stay on track and makes the output easier to copy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
  <a name="references" href="#references">
  </a>
  References 📚
</h3>

<p>References = examples. But don’t just show good examples — show bad ones, too. And explain <strong>why</strong> they’re wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: Valid Commit Message</strong> ✅</p>

<p><code>feat(api): Add new endpoint for user authentication</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Proper capitalization</li>
<li>No ending punctuation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 2: Valid Commit Message</strong> ✅</p>

<p><code>build!(deps): Update dependencies to version 2.0, v1.0 no longer supported</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Breaking changes indicator (<code>!</code>) placed properly</li>
<li>Clear guidance on how to handle the upgrade</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 3: Invalid Commit Message</strong> ❌</p>

<p><code>feat(api): add new endpoint for user authentication</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Subject line must be capitalized after the colon.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 4: Invalid Commit Message</strong> ❌</p>

<p><code>build(deps)!: Update dependencies to version 2.0 for all dev dependencies, v1.0 no longer supported</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Subject line is too long and the <code>!</code> is in the wrong place.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The point</strong>: don’t just say “do this” — explain the <em>why</em>, too, using repeatable patterns in a format that Copilot (or anyone) will understand.</p>

  Reflection: Making Your Prompts Work <em>With</em> You 🪞
</h2>

<p>You don’t have to use all five elements every time — this isn’t a strict framework or secret spellbook. Take what works for your workflow and leave the rest. </p>

<p>But when things start going sideways (and they will), having a clear foundation and answers to the most common prompt failures will help you troubleshoot faster and build better:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Persona</strong> – Make Copilot a character with intent and tone</li>
<li>
<strong>Requirements</strong> – Define exactly what “done” means</li>
<li>
<strong>Impediments</strong> – Call out blockers and anti-patterns in advance</li>
<li>
<strong>Outcomes</strong> – Spell out what a good response looks like, including format</li>
<li>
<strong>References</strong> – Show clear examples (the good <em>and</em> the not-so-good)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you’re building reusable instructions or just refining your day-to-day prompts, <strong>PRIOR</strong> gives you a structure to experiment, iterate, and actually enjoy the process. </p>

<p>And if all else fails? Go weird. Go wild. Go off the rails if you have to! Sometimes a little dose of 'unexpected' is exactly what gets a stuck prompt moving again — and Copilot? It tends to roll with it better than you'd think. 🧙</p>

<h2>

<p>Got something you’ve been stuck on? Or waiting for someone to finally explain? Drop it below — I’d love to dig into it in a future post.  </p>

<p><strong>Next week</strong>: We’re diving into prompt chaining — multi-step flows where the <em>reusable</em> part of this series can really shine! It’s structured, powerful, and (let’s be honest) just a little unpredictable in the best possible way. 🎢</p>
