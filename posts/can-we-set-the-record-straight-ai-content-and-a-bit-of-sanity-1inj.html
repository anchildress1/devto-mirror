  <article><blockquote>
<p>🦄 I survived the hackathon, caught up on sleep (mostly), and the AI debate? Still going strong—at least in my head. If my last posts seemed like a soapbox, let’s try a new approach. This isn’t just for the devs or the writers—it’s anyone online trying to build, break, or create something honest.</p>
</blockquote>

  <a href="#background-because-the-story-matters">
  </a>
  Background (because the story matters) ✍️
</h2>

<p>Here’s what gets me: <strong>people still treat all AI content the same</strong>—whether it’s auto-generated fluff or a post like this, with actual thought, stubbornness, and a few creative detours baked in. I use AI as a tool, but I’m the one steering; it’s got my fingerprints and my voice all over it because I wrote intentional AI instructions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🙄 At least, unless GPT-5 has decided to rewrite the rules again. Then it takes a bit of wrangling first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sad part? Both the creative writing and the fluff get the same knee-jerk reaction. I’m not worried about myself—I know how to handle criticism and don’t mind being upfront. But not everyone’s ready to jump into the ring, and a lot of good AI assisted work gets buried because creators just don’t want to deal with the drama that comes with disclosure.</p>

<p>Hang out in the writers+AI corners of the internet for five minutes and you’ll hear: “Just don’t disclose—why invite the hassle?” That’s not me. I’d rather own it, even if it means the occasional argument. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🥊 Integrity first, sparring match second—and my matches usually come with a grin and a little happy dance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let’s walk through what we <em>actually</em> know about AI, what we’re still sorting out, and how we might just learn to disagree without burning the place down before it's sorted. 🔥👩‍🚒</p>

  <a href="#1-whos-really-at-the-table">
  </a>
  1. Who’s Really at the Table? 🗝️
</h2>

<p>Platforms, publishers, workplaces, classrooms, and every Discord mod with a badge gets to set their own boundaries. But the thing that always gets me isn’t <em>if</em> they do it, it’s <em>how</em>. When ‘boundaries’ become a one-size-fits-all firewall, that’s where I have a problem.</p>

<p>For example: KoFi’s Discord rules are direct—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“All forms of AI-generated content (eg. art/music/writing/ChatGPT), including links to such content, and discussion thereof is not allowed in this server.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, of course, I checked. “Does that mean <em>my</em> stuff is banned?” Turns out, nope. As long as I skip the preview images, we’re golden. Honest, straightforward, no drama. <em>Awesome.</em></p>

<p>Medium, though? (If you missed the post, <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/medium-and-the-blanket-ai-ban-2cni">catch up here</a>.) They talked about gray areas... <em>then</em> built a giant penalty box for every AI-assisted creator, regardless of intent or craft. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🎵 For me, that’s about as thoughtful as banning all musicians because someone played Wonderwall one too many times at open mic night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t rewrite the rulebook, but I can refuse to act like these blanket rules don’t erase good, thoughtful people. Those of us who are trying to follow guidelines that don't really exist—and perhaps set a few new ones in the process—don't deserve to have our work lumped together with the slop.</p>


<hr>

<h2>
  <a href="#2-ai-content-%E2%89%A0-equal">
  </a>
  2. AI Content ≠ Equal 🥚
</h2>

<p>There’s AI content, and then there’s <em>AI content</em>. Some of it is shallow, spammy filler that's cranked out for clicks with zero thought or care. The rest of us? It’s a tool wielded well: organized, rewritten, and given a real voice. </p>

<p><strong>Bad actors weren’t invented along with AI; the existing ones just found a different shortcut.</strong></p>

<p>There are tools out there—<a href="https://www.zerogpt.com/">ZeroGPT</a> and friends—that claim they’ll catch every AI post. But here’s the thing: I’ve actually tested this. I picked three or four posts at random, ran them through different detectors, and my highest score was 18%. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 It’s not because I’m hiding anything or using some secret hack. <strong>It’s the process.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dictate most posts on the fly. Then I hand it off to the AI—to organize, to reword, sometimes to rewrite completely—but always under <em>my</em> set of rules. And it never, ever ends as a copy-paste job. I’m editing the whole time. There’s always a human—<em>me</em>—in the loop, every single time.</p>


<hr>

<h2>
  <a href="#3-will-ai-improve-productivity">
  </a>
  3. Will AI Improve Productivity? 🏃‍♀️
</h2>

<p>Sometimes. Sometimes Not. </p>

<p>There’s always a promise: AI will make you ten times faster, smarter, better, insert-your-buzzword-here. And maybe it’s true... <em>sometimes</em>. Documentation? Absolutely. I can roll out a draft in seconds—clean, organized, done. Drafting proposals? Don’t even get me started; I’m pretty sure the principals are getting sick of how fast I can toss together a pitch. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>😇 If they aren’t yet, give it time because I have more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But sometimes AI just saves you from the jobs nobody wants. Like, digging through a decade’s worth of legacy code for a spike because it’s finally time to rebuild that app and nobody remembers what it's actually doing or why it was even there to begin with. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🫤 I know <em>I</em> don’t want to do that. <em>You</em> don’t want to do that. <strong><em>Nobody</em> wants to do that.</strong> AI doesn't care and is pretty good at it! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, sometimes it sees connections I might miss. But that doesn’t mean you can skip the whole process and trust whatever it finds. You still have to check. Maybe it saves you three days in the depths of the code mines, but <strong>the human review isn’t optional.</strong></p>

<p>Still, not every job should go to the bots, either. That gnarly production bug, that support ticket, the customer call—they all need a human. AI can be a superpower, but it’s not meant to replace the parts of your work that need actual judgment, empathy, or the magic of figuring it out together.</p>

  4. AI Is Not Bad (When You Use It Like a Pro) 👨‍🚀
</h2>

<p>AI isn’t some villain lurking in your workflow. It’s a force multiplier. Used right, it makes your voice sharper and your edits faster—used wrong, it just adds to the noise.</p>

<p>That’s why every single commit I make defines exactly how much AI was involved and my posts are going to start wearing an “AI-Edited” badge. Not because someone told me to. Not as a disclaimer. <strong>Because <em>somebody</em> has to be willing to say there's a difference between generated and assisted.</strong></p>

<p>This is one version (and yes—Leonardo made them):</p>

  5. AI Code Is AI Content (Writers, You Too!) 💾
</h2>

<p>Here’s my rule: disclosure, plain and simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Docs and posts: Add a simple footer like “This was generated with the help of AI tool.”</li>
<li>Code or technical writing: Commit with one of 3 different footers in the commit message:

<ul>
<li>
<code>Generated-with: AI tool</code> means AI did most or all of the work</li>
<li>
<code>Co-authored-by: AI tool</code> means the content is 50/50</li>
<li>
<code>Assisted-with: AI tool</code> means AI helped some, but not close to half</li>
</ul>


</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 I started out using an email address in the commits, too — that <em>I thought</em> I was making up—until some random app popped up as a contributor in my repo. <em>Not cool...</em> 😒</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t about checking boxes. It’s about giving credit, setting an example, and actually being transparent with yourself and the future people who end up needing it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>😈 Besides, putting one more stamp on a long list of responsible AI use-cases puts a dent in the endless cycle of AI panic and the-world-is-ending doom speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#6-and-what-about-ai-images-or-music">
  </a>
  6. And What About AI Images or Music? 🎨
</h2>

<p>Same rules, different paint. Some artists pour weeks or months into training models on their own art. (I still haven’t managed to train mine and it's been over a month!) Others take the shortcut: punch in a sentence or two, let the AI “enhance” it, and call it done. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>❓ Are they copying someone’s style? I dunno—<em>maybe</em>? Should they? I honestly don’t know...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same applies here as does with writing: <strong>artists absolutely have the right to protect their work.</strong> But what does that look like, practically? Truth is we don’t really know yet. The laws are behind while the tech is still racing ahead. We’ll catch up. Maybe not soon enough, but eventually, we will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 I just hope that when we get there, there’s at least <em>one person</em> in the room who actually understands what’s happening—and what it looks like behind the scenes. <strong>We absolutely need better laws,</strong> but <strong>we do not need people throwing broad rules at some conjured image of “AI training.”</strong> Whatever it ends up being, honesty and fact need to come first.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#7-is-ai-stealing-no-but">
  </a>
  7. Is AI “Stealing”? (No, but...) 🧬
</h2>

<p>This is where I dig in my heels. No, using AI-generated content is <em>not</em> stealing—<em>unless</em> you’re actively pretending someone else’s work is your own or ignoring copyright on purpose. However, “publicly available” isn’t the same as “public domain,” and <strong><em>nobody</em> should lose credit for their work.</strong></p>

<p>Should AI companies pay for certain data? Probably! Should writers and artists get a say? Of course. But “all AI is theft” is just as over-simplified as “all creators are saints.” </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🫡 Guess what? Real life and the world around us is messy—AI included. We need smarter laws, better tools, <strong>and way less finger-pointing.</strong></p>

<p>I can't just sit back and watch the insanity and <em>not</em> throw my two cents in. <strong>We’re all still figuring this thing out.</strong> Some jumped in headfirst, others are barely dipping a toe.
