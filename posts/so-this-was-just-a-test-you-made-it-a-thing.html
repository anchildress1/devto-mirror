<h2>
  
  
  Confession
</h2>

<p>When I first decided to start blogging, it was <strong>just another random experiment</strong> to see what would happen... just a sly way to gauge the general response to my ideas before I non-officially stuck a "MINE" flag in the SME title for Copilot at work. 🏴‍☠️</p>

<p>It was never meant to be more than that — <em>just a quick test</em> I was only semi-invested in. Honestly, I invested <em>just enough</em> to know whether or not to change my strategy before shouting it to the rest of the company. That was the sum total of my initial intent.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Fast forward
</h2>

<p>I somehow ended up with <strong>actual people followers</strong> (you know — <em>real people</em>, not bots!). Now these posts are going to LinkedIn too (thanks for starting that <a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/georgekobaidze">@georgekobaidze</a>!) Eventually, I’ll get them back to Confluence where they were supposed to be originally anyway (although this is definitely <em>way more fun</em>)! 🤩</p>

<p>So, sincerely — thank you to everyone who’s encouraged or supported me along the way. I wouldn’t still be writing these without you! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if you’re just lurking in the background — I see you, too. 👀 <br />
You be you. Just don’t be afraid to join the party sometimes, yeah?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a couple months of posting, I’ve realized this blog isn’t going anywhere. And even though Dev.to is super casual, I didn’t want to start shouting into the void at random without first setting a <em>tiny</em> bit of structure. 🤏</p>

<p>Plus, I work better under pressure. So think of this next part as my self-applied <strong>anti-procrastination machine</strong> fueled by too much caffeine. ⏱️☕</p>




<h3>
  
  
  📅 1. Weekly Copilot Posts
</h3>

<p>Every Wednesday morning(ish), expect a new post diving into my current favorite topic: GitHub Copilot. You can expect the useful, the weird, the frustrating, the dramatic — and everything in between. That could be lunchtime in London, dinnertime in Delhi, or “oops I overslept (<em>again</em>)” on the East Coast. ⏰</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> It’s not that I <em>can’t</em> schedule them at the exact same time every week... it just physically hurts to not sprinkle in a little "unpredictable" (welcome to my brain!) I might be able to handle the structure, but I need that tiny piece of random to keep my inner Loki happy. 🦊</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So - <strong>same-ish time every Wednesday = GitHub Copilot</strong>, give or take an hour from 8AM EDT.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  🌪️ 2. Surprise Posts (Like This)
</h3>

<p>The rest? Unfiltered, unscheduled, mildly chaotic, and completely unpredictable “thought dumps” that don’t fit neatly into a Copilot post. Even I don't know when a moment will strike! Like this one (and the other few random thoughts in my ChatGPT that are sure to follow soon).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the unannounced bursts of “I have thoughts and <em>SOMEBODY</em> should listen!” But mostly driven by the tiny Gremlin at the keyboard that occasionally hijacks my routine just for fun. 👾</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that's my "un-officially official" plan — no backing out now. But honestly... I've been having a blast! Y’all are awesome, and I couldn’t have found a better group of people to share, chat, and learn with. 💕</p>
