<p>I was doing something completely unrelated and somehow ended up staring at my profile page - the editable text field practically begging me to try it. And... it worked! 🎉 I finally feel like myself again!</p>




<p>The brief rounds of testing I did say the auto-redirect will handle any references or links that are out there, but <strong>just in case</strong> I apologize in advance if anything gets <em>weird</em>. Let me know if you run into problems from the switch!</p>

<p>Everything I share here is my own perspective—created with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop. I do my best to catch accidental bias and fact-check, but if you ever spot something odd, let me know! AI isn’t perfect, and neither am I.</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> AI helped, but you can blame me for the <strong>chaos</strong>! 🫠</p>
