<p>🦄 Hey friends! I finally took the break I’ve been semi-planning for a while. Honestly, I almost extended it but I don’t much know what to do with myself if I’m not writing something every little bit—so here I am, up <em>way too late</em> (with appetizers, nonetheless). Partly delirious is, clearly, the perfect state for writing this post. You may consider yourself adequately notified (and sufficiently warned) that I make no promises of sense from this point forward! 🥱💤✍️</p>

<p>I am also fully aware of the missing half to <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/did-ai-erase-attribution-your-git-history-is-missing-a-co-author-1m2l">the RAI Attribution post</a> that I keep saying I’ll write—and I will, <em>eventually</em>. I’m gonna blame GitHub partly, because their last release must have set a record somewhere. I’ve spent days reading notes, testing, circling back, and still finding things I somehow missed the first three passes.  </p>

<p>The bigger piece, though, is that I had an idea (<em>okay—several ideas</em> 🤷‍♀️) and need a little time to see if it can actually work. So nearly all my hours have gone to coding and prompting instead of writing. Can’t be helped—this situation currently demands my attention! Besides, arguing with those voices when they insist never ends well, so it’s faster to just give in from the start.👂🌀 </p>

  GitHub Universe Review 🪐
</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, one of <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/#h-the-state-of-github-in-2025-a-year-of-record-growth">GitHub’s recent updates</a> claims they’re adding a new user every second—<strong>36 million new developers</strong> this year alone. That’s about a 20% jump in everything GitHub, and AI tops the list. Which means Copilot just got a <em>lot</em> of upgrades.</p>

<p>Thanks to last week’s incredibly full—<em>read: excessive</em>—release, I don’t know when I’ll catch up again. So I pulled together the ones that hit me hardest in a semi-ordered manner. Whether that’s good or bad, we’ll see! ⚖️😳  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Nobody needs <em>thirty</em> feature drops in a single day. 🙄 Go look at the last week of October! <em>GitHub, what were y’all thinking?</em> Especially when <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe ’25</a> was happening the same day!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>"Brave" is one word</strong> for it. This particular dev calls it a near-perfect example of "<em>glutton for punishment</em>"—and it’s moved in next door to "<em>Friday deployments</em>". Honestly, you guys deserve a medal for sheer nerve, lots of luck, and probable animal sacrifice required to pull that one off successfully. 🥇👏🙇‍♀️</p>

<h2>
  <a href="#1-agents-agents-and-more-agents">
  </a>
  1. Agents, Agents, and More Agents 🦾🎭
</h2>

<p>If your days are spent inside VS Code, then by far the most impactful change GitHub announced starts with a complete overhaul to chat modes. The obvious shift is that anything formerly known as a <code>chat mode</code> is now an <code>agent</code> in GitHub's universe. VS Code editor UI is catching up quickly, but configuration via repository files works today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 <em>Why, yes!</em> That <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/github-copilot-chat-modes-explained-with-personality-2f4c">"chat modes" mini-series</a> I <strong>quite literally <em>just finished</em></strong> immediately won the "poorly timed posts requiring instant corrections" award. 🙄 Honestly, I'm not really surprised—and absolutely worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anything that currently lives in a <code>.github/chatmodes/*.chatmode.md</code> file can be safely relocated to its new home in <strong><code>.github/agents/*.agent.md</code></strong>. Besides a few settings, everything else in VS Code should still function the exact same way—but watch for the release notes to drop. The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_105">official release notes</a> should always be your version of truth.</p>

<p>If you're part of an organization or enterprise, there's a reserved <code>&lt;org-name&gt;/.github</code> repository available where you can drop your agents at <strong><code>./agents/*.agent.md</code></strong>. For the internal version, add your agents in a repo at <strong><code>&lt;org-name&gt;/.github-private/agents/*.agent.md</code></strong> instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 I haven't tested enterprise yet. I was already impatient with the whole approval process before this rose to a FOMO event! <em>Naturally</em>, I assigned "urgent" work to random <em>somewhat adjacent</em> roles (after I stretched) with a shocking level of confidence in this process I was defining as I went. Spoiler—I'm still waiting! ⏳😅</p>

  2. Agents Dashboard 🧭
</h2>

<p>Once you catch up on the rename, your favorite sparkly personalities are now fully compatible with Copilot coding agent. They live in the new <strong>Agents panel</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9fxceoq0tt3dazyy0w1o.png%3Fv%3D2025"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9fxceoq0tt3dazyy0w1o.png%3Fv%3D2025" alt="Screenshot new GitHub Copilot Agents Panel with custom agent options" loading="lazy" width="1146" height="868"></a></p>

<p>You’ll also see an <strong>Agents tab</strong> that lets you steer Copilot’s coding agent mid-workflow—without killing your current run. Every send still costs a premium request, so use wisely!</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fceauyv4xj8v924qotbqh.png%3Fv%3D2025"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fceauyv4xj8v924qotbqh.png%3Fv%3D2025" alt="Screenshot of GitHub Copilot coding agent new tab view" loading="lazy" width="2038" height="922"></a></p>

  <a href="#3-for-the-cli-folks">
  </a>
  3. For the CLI Folks 🖥️
</h2>

<p>The new Copilot CLI is <em>legit</em>. Custom agents now extend to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#use-custom-agents">latest CLI docs</a>, which I haven't tested nearly as much as I'd like. Once you get the agent shared with either your repo or org, then use the <code>/agent</code> command or <code>--agent=&lt;name&gt;</code> flag. There’s even mention of a local <code>~/.copilot/agents</code> directory for global use—needs testing, but it’s promising.  </p>

<p>GitHub also slipped in <em>enhanced model selection, image support, and a streamlined UI</em> in the October set of updates, making the CLI feel far more polished.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnc7yuizmmueqlhwacczy.png%3Fv%3D2025"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnc7yuizmmueqlhwacczy.png%3Fv%3D2025" alt="Screenshot of GitHub CLI with custom agent selection" loading="lazy" width="1002" height="340"></a></p>

  4. Coding agent reaches further ✨
</h2>

<p>Copilot coding agent can now work on any open pull request—not just the one it created. Use the same <code>@copilot</code> mention you’d use on a Copilot PR, watch the little eyes 👀 pop up, and let coding agent get to work. </p>

<p>It also works through Slack (assuming your Slack permissions actually line up) and through the new Copilot CLI. I would be much more excited about this development if work and GitHub weren’t in a stalemate over one permission that blocks access entirely. 🙁</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 I do have a plan for the Slack issue… <em>sort of.</em> Something must be done about this disservice to the Slack population! Until then, the receipts are here: <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-ask-copilot-coding-agent-to-make-changes-in-any-pull-request-with-copilot/">coding agent in any PR</a> and <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-work-with-copilot-coding-agent-in-slack">coding agent in Slack</a>. ✨</p>

  5. Smarter Copilot Code Reviews 🧾
</h2>

<p>I've always loved <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-new-public-preview-features-in-copilot-code-review-ai-reviews-that-see-the-full-picture">Copilot's code reviews</a>! It was a game changer when Copilot was able to pull instructions automatically from any repo. This latest change is just as impressive—now your CodeQL and ESLint integrations can be checked automatically whenever Copilot performs a review. There's rumor about more linters on the way, soon! </p>

<p>One of my current favorite features includes these handy little notifications that pop up any time a linter error occurs in the most recent build. If you're not seeing them yet, you might need the preview feature enabled. Follow instructions in <a href="https://dev.to/anchildress1/magical-coding-agent-the-ship-ready-spellbook-2mbf#firstenable-the-cool-stuff">this previous post</a>. 😇 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 When someone at work asked me why my PR was littered with lint warnings, my immediate response was, "<em>I know—isn't it great!</em> 😁" Then I had to explain the divergent thought process that I completely failed to recognize through my initial excitement. </p>

<p>I did get around to it, eventually: <em>"It's only great because these highlight the existing issues that would have been handled had I been aware of their existence. <strong>And</strong> I've just made it nearly impossible for any more to sneak in without notice!"</em> Feel free to inject all the fervor you'd expect from a 7-year-old after a full bag of skittles for maximum immersive effect. 🫣</p>

  <a href="#6-new-embeddings-smarter-copilot">
  </a>
  6. New Embeddings = Smarter Copilot 🧠
</h2>

<p>This is the quiet one of the group, but seriously impressive nonetheless! This quiet update is huge—embeddings now drive faster, more accurate code retrieval for Copilot. <strong>GitHub’s Sept 2025 update reports +110%/+113% acceptance for C#/Java in VS Code, with ~37.6% retrieval gains.</strong> Most people won’t even notice—they’ll just feel Copilot getting <em>smarter</em>.  </p>

<p>Considering almost all of my Java friends are still IntelliJ Enthusiasts, despite my persistence of missing out. And who knows what my C# friends are up to—mostly hiding, I think! 🤔 </p>

  7. Roster Rotation Changes the Lineup 🎭
</h2>

<p><strong>Quick reality check:</strong> model lineups shift fast. Treat anything labeled preview or legacy as volatile and pin versions until you’ve verified replacements behave the same.</p>

<p>GitHub is really pushing the newest versions, which I'm 100% on board with—except for one <em>tiny-ish-not-really</em> complaint. 🤏 <em>What in the world are we supposed to use instead of the o-series models?</em> I've seen the suggestion, which, as of this week, is drop in GPT-5 as the go-to replacement.</p>

<p><em>Seriously</em>? Surely somebody thought through it more than that! I, no doubt, would have started a fresh debate with myself for making that utterly ridiculous suggestion! 😑</p>

<p>I'm not saying GPT-5 can't handle the job—it <em>probably</em> does fine after some solid instructions and guardrails are set up—but it's not the replacement data magician that the <strong><em>now-entirely-unsupported</em> o-series</strong> mastered. <em>Not even a little close!</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 Honestly, I could get behind Gemini 2.5 Pro before GPT-5 on this one. For the very small-scoped runs, GPT-5-mini does top the freebie list. I guess we'll just have to see how this goes!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other notable retirees include everyone on team Anthropic &lt; v4, including Opus and Sonnet Thinking. Granted Claude 3.5 has a <em>tiny</em> bit of life left still, but cake and cards are scheduled to be delivered tomorrow for the goodbye party—November 6, 2025.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 For the record, if anyone asks me about the grander playing field of all Copilot models that we got in return? I've got very few complaints overall. I'm not going to be happy about it until I see a realistic replacement for my data magician, though. 😒 Get your latest model news from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models">the GitHub docs</a>.</p>

  8. GitHub Spark 🔥
</h2>

<p>Spark is still limited to enterprise users plus a lucky few from the waiting list. You should consider this a special agentic "Bob the Builder" that's designed to output a very specific full-stack system: React + TypeScript + Cosmos DB + Azure deploys. I've yet to see anything impressive resembling a backend—but it's entirely possible I gave up before it had a chance.</p>

<p><strong>Spark is not Copilot</strong>—if you try to ask it a question or if your prompt looks like a conversation, then you'll pay <strong>4 premium requests</strong> for crickets (at best). 🦗 </p>

<p>You can open the Spark app in a codespace with Copilot (or so it says on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/spark#develop-your-spark-with-copilot">this docs page</a>). The two very independent systems are supposed to sync automatically, which is like two siblings arguing over whose turn it is to play with the new friend in town, if you ask me! But at least it's functional chaos. 👯</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 I'm not even gonna pretend to feel guilty about getting early Spark access. 😆 As far as I'm concerned—between GitHub and work (it's mostly a toss-up)—I deserved that access long before I realized I already had it.</p>

<p>Natural-language GitHub Actions Agentic Workflows got a short spotlight at Universe. Write a YAML-ish markdown file, run <code>gh aw add ...</code>, and it becomes a new workflow. I’m still testing the scalability and reuse story.  </p>

<p>I’m not sure yet what this does that coding agent + CLI can’t, but I plan to find out. They have several examples, but the <a href="https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/update-docs.md">"Regular Documentation Update"</a> workflow stands out—because if there’s a <em>non-regular</em> one, I have questions!</p>

  10. Not Nearly Everything 🔍
</h2>

<p>There’s plenty I left out on purpose: quiet CLI refinements, the auto-model picker (based on <em>availability</em>), smarter branch/PR optimizations, and Copilot Spaces with <strong>increased size and repo limits</strong>—which is starting to look like GitHub positioning them to replace enterprise knowledge bases (that would be a good call!) 🧐</p>

<p>Then there’s the quietly rolled-out <strong>enhanced metrics reporting</strong> via the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-11-03-manage-budgets-and-track-usage-with-new-billing-api-updates/">new billing API updates</a>. Teams can finally <em>see</em> their usage—numbers, budgets, and who’s burning through premium requests fastest. Transparency: gift or curse? Guess we'll know who's winning the Premium Request Usage Leaderboard when stats drop at the end of the month.</p>

  Friendly PSA for the GitHub MCP ‼️
</h2>

<p>The <strong>GitHub MCP server also got a major boost</strong> with the latest updates, including multi-tool definitions and enhanced defaults for Copilot. Very cool, until Copilot decided to be extra "<em>helpful</em>".</p>

<ul>
<li>My first clue something was off: my name alerting on a merged PR that wasn’t mine. 😲</li>
<li>Second: I definitely didn’t click merge! 🤨</li>
<li>Then the <strong>prod deploy</strong> pipeline started humming happily, but nothing is approved. 😱</li>
<li>Panic queues while Copilot joyously generates release notes for the occasion. 😡</li>
<li>Don't worry—everything was fine. I stopped the catastrophe and was able to restore to an equivalent state. 😅</li>
</ul>

<p>As soon as I recovered, I pulled all the tools from the official GitHub MCP and <strong>it could have been <em>much, much worse</em>!</strong> Like "DROP REPO" kinds of <em>"worse"</em>! Can you imagine how very bad that sort of day would be? Nope—I don't want to either!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> If you’re using GitHub’s MCP (especially if you're admin anywhere), stop and review which tools are enabled by default. Trust me. You do <em>not</em> want to learn what happens following an “accidental DROP REPO” command. 😵</p>
