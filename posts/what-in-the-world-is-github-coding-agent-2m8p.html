&lt;p&gt;ü¶Ñ You know, I&#39;ve been ready to write this post for ages. This is the &lt;em&gt;one thing&lt;/em&gt; that got me hooked on AI to begin with, and I&#39;m still obsessed. But now that I&#39;m here? I&#39;m almost, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; too tired to even enjoy it. And because I&#39;m a ride-or-die kind of person ‚Äî either all in or over it yesterday ‚Äî we&#39;re just going to dive headfirst into the shallow end. No holding back ‚Äî I hope you&#39;re ready! üõü&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png&#34; alt=&#34;short dotted horizontal divider&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#your-10minute-101-to-get-you-started-with-autonomous-ai&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Your 10-minute 101 to get you started with autonomous AI ‚è∞
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly? there&#39;s &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; I can cover everything about GitHub Coding Agent in one go. So, for this post üëá, we&#39;re doing the &#34;just enough to be dangerous&#34; thing. I&#39;ll hit you with the absolute must-knows, show you how to get started (in 10 minutes or less), and &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt;, not put you to sleep in the process (or myself!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to give you a &#34;preview teaser&#34; so you can go play, explore a bit, and maybe even tackle that hack time project you keep putting off. But whatever you do, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don&#39;t think this is your all-inclusive pass to go wild on production code. ü´°&lt;/p&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#coding-agent-%E2%89%A0-agent-mode&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coding Agent ‚â† Agent Mode ü§™
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let&#39;s get something straight right off the bat, because these names are just asking for trouble. Yes, they both have &#34;GitHub&#34; and &#34;Agent&#34; in the name. And yes, they&#39;re both powered by Claude Sonnet 4, but &lt;strong&gt;that&#39;s where the similarities stop.&lt;/strong&gt; Agent Mode is for in-IDE use, a bit like a sidekick who waits for you to tell it what to do next. Coding Agent? It&#39;s the whole show ‚Äî a full-on autonomous workflow that runs on its own dedicated VM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üí° &lt;strong&gt;ProTip:&lt;/strong&gt; Custom instructions and prompt techniques are the secret sauce here. This is true for any Gen-AI tool, but it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;especially critical&lt;/em&gt; with Coding Agent, which will just keep guessing until it runs out of steam or thinks the job is done. Don&#39;t let it run wild without a map!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t worry, Coding Agent is designed with safety in mind. It&#39;s an incredibly contained, safe version of the &#34;autonomous coding&#34; experiment I ran on my own a while back. I spent 45 days arguing with a thing I wired up on my laptop, and I worked harder then than on any other project I&#39;ve built before or since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because I didn&#39;t want to just listen to what people were saying about AI ‚Äî I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to see it for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ü¶Ñ And that, my friends, is why I&#39;m here volunteering as your guide. If you get stuck, hit me up! I&#39;ve probably tried it that way plus three other insane ideas before I found one that mostly worked üôÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#safety-first-chaos-second&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Safety First, Chaos Second üõ°Ô∏è
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know... I just spent a whole paragraph telling you how much I love this thing, and now I&#39;m gonna give you the other half of the equation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m all for pushing a new tool to its absolute limit, just to see what happens. It reminds me of my favorite Hunter S. Thompson quote ‚Äî which I slightly mangled to get a SFW version ‚Äî but the core truth remains: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a new, beautiful wave, &lt;strong&gt;the tendency is to push it as far as you can.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how far can you push GitHub Coding Agent? Pretty far, but there are a few things you need to know first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png&#34; alt=&#34;short dotted horizontal divider&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#1-just-because-you-can-doesnt-mean-you-should&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Just Because You Can, Doesn&#39;t Mean You &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool can absolutely excel, but it requires the right prompt, instructions, and general setup. If you&#39;re looking to dive into some legacy code to see what&#39;s what, or maybe you want a safe playground to mess around in, then this is your guy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you&#39;re thinking about using it to fix a production bug, especially when you&#39;re on a tight deadline, you probably (aka absolutely, most definitely) want to reconsider. Treat this as a &#34;learn how this works&#34; project, not a &#34;throw it at a problem and hope&#34; situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6rv2yc0bs2pwe59a6k5p.png&#34; alt=&#34;short dotted horizontal divider&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#2-your-prompt-is-everything&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Your Prompt is Everything
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of your instructions and prompt is multiplied exponentially by the complexity of your task. A great, well-thought-out set of instructions that you&#39;ve carefully tweaked over weeks? Coding Agent will do fine. But if you spend 10 minutes throwing a few sentences together just to see what happens, don&#39;t be surprised when you come back to a haunted house where your beautiful little cottage of a codebase used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ü¶Ñ It is an agent and when an agent doesn&#39;t know something, &lt;em&gt;they guess&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;That&#39;s just what they do.&lt;/strong&gt; The only thing more dangerous than an AI off the rails and hallucinating is the fact that you just turned it loose on your code all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#what-its-actually-good-for&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What It&#39;s Actually Good For ‚ú®
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all those warnings, I need to make it crystal clear: &lt;strong&gt;this tool is not dangerous.&lt;/strong&gt; It runs on its own virtual machine and executes safely within GitHub Actions. It has a limited environment and only has access to what you explicitly give it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;always creates a new branch&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a key safety feature. You can&#39;t get around it, even if you try. Trust me, I was annoyed, but the safety is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you realistically use this for? Here are some of my favorite real-world use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing has worked better for me than using Coding Agent to dive deep into a codebase and spit out test-ready use cases or a handful of detailed system architecture Mermaid diagrams. You set it loose, go get a coffee, and come back to 7-8 pages of detailed, well-researched use cases ready to be plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; This one&#39;s a little controversial for a test-driven development purist like me, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;... when you&#39;re on a deadline and you just need to get things done, you can write the code and have Coding Agent go write the tests. It&#39;s not a perfect solution, but a pull request with 28/30 passing tests is way better than one with zero tests at all. ü§´ü´£&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Project Planning:&lt;/strong&gt; Got a big initiative coming up? Instead of spending a week flipping through pages of dead code to figure out how it used to work, you can have Coding Agent do the heavy lifting and print out a nifty little report when it&#39;s done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-get-started-in-5-minutes-or-less&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Get Started in 5 Minutes or Less ‚è±Ô∏è
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interest of time and keeping this digestible, I&#39;m going to give you the basics that will work 100% of the time. We&#39;ll dig in on some more tools next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has made this incredibly accessible now. You can find the new &lt;strong&gt;agents panel&lt;/strong&gt; button on just about every page in GitHub: both on the home page and within any repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft0y20jjys62xwrj9bb3x.png%3Fv%3D2&#34; alt=&#34;GitHub new agents panel view to access Coding Agent&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the Repository and Base Branch:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose the repo and the branch you want Coding Agent to work from. It will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; create its own branch, so don&#39;t worry about selecting &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; (or a trunk-based development model) if that&#39;s your primary branch. I&#39;m telling you, you can &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to tell it not to create a branch, but it&#39;s not going to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craft Your Prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; your typical conversational prompting. Coding Agent &lt;em&gt;will keep guessing&lt;/em&gt; until it reaches what it considers to be &#34;complete.&#34; Save yourself the headache and give it all the info up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submit Your Request:&lt;/strong&gt; Every time you hit send, it&#39;s considered one premium request. This is why it&#39;s so important to be concise and provide all the context it needs upfront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üí° &lt;strong&gt;ProTip:&lt;/strong&gt; To save premium requests when reviewing Copilot&#39;s PR, go to the diff page and leave all your &lt;code&gt;@copilot&lt;/code&gt; comments as pending. When you&#39;re ready, submit them all at once, and it will only cost you &lt;em&gt;one request&lt;/em&gt; whether you leave two comments or 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#a-final-warning-about-responsibility&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Final Warning About Responsibility üòà
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, one last thing. I have to let this sink in: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; prompt, it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;your code&lt;/em&gt;. Period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go out and give a prompt to Copilot, ignore it for 30 minutes, do a half-hearted review, approve your own pull request, override the protection rules to push it to main, and then the codebase burns down... that&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; Copilot&#39;s fault. That&#39;s your fault. Your prompt, your branch, your code, AI or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, be aware, be smart, and &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don&#39;t use this as an excuse to ignore the basics. Start small with documentation or tests, and work your way up.&lt;/p&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;
