  <p><em>Published: 2025-07-16T12:05:00Z</em></p>
  <article><p>It hit me the other day - I haven’t been great about adding RAI disclaimers (especially around here). Most of the time I remember, but when I’m deep in the zone - or stuck on that “Copilot, just LISTEN!” rollercoaster - it’s easy to forget.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve gone back and added those RAI footers (like I should’ve from the start), let’s take a real look at what actually matters - and how you can handle it, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🙏 Not an expert - just someone sharing what I’ve learned in the wild. If you spot something out-of-date or just plain wrong, drop a comment. Help me help <em>everyone</em> - no shame, just learning!</p>
</blockquote>




<h2>
  
  
  ⚡ TL;DR
</h2>

<ul>
<li>🧰 <strong>Copilot is a tool, not a magic wand.</strong> Your name’s on the code - no matter who (or what) wrote it.</li>
<li>👀 <strong>RAI is everyone’s job.</strong> Know Copilot’s strengths <em>and</em> blind spots before you release.</li>
<li>📝 <strong>Disclose everything!</strong> If Copilot helped, make it obvious - especially in reports, docs, and commits.</li>
<li>🫱🏾‍🫲🏼 <strong>Not every fix is an AI job</strong> - there are times only you (with your team) can solve it.</li>
<li>🔬 <strong>Don’t skip basics:</strong> Plan, test, document - don’t get lazy just because AI’s fast.</li>
<li>🧃 <strong>No AI scapegoats:</strong> Copilot’s just a sidekick. If it leads you off a cliff, you were still in the captain’s chair.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🌈 What Is Responsible AI (and Why Care)?
</h2>

<p>Think “college ethics class” plus a heavy sprinkle of real-world weirdness. RAI is primarily about two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How the provider (GitHub, Microsoft, etc.) designs and delivers Copilot</strong> - safe, fair, and transparent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Want the official version? <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check Microsoft's builders page</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How you use Copilot (or any AI)</strong> - what you build, how you share it, and what you let out into the world. That’s the half I’m tackling here.</p></li>
</ol>




<h2>
  
  
  🔒 The “Yeah, But” List: Copilot Limitations
</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide?tool=vscode#limitations-of-github-copilot-chat" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub’s official docs</a>, plus my spin for maximum realness:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Limited Scope:</strong> Obscure tech? Weird edge case? Copilot’s probably lost before you get started.</li>
<li>
<strong>Potential Biases:</strong> Yes, it can <em>learn</em> and <em>perpetuate biases</em>, just like people do. Keep your eyes peeled.</li>
<li>
<strong>Security Risks:</strong> AI can accidentally leak secrets or create vulnerabilities. Don’t copy-paste blindly!</li>
<li>
<strong>Matches with Public Code:</strong> That “original” Copilot snippet might be living its best life somewhere else on GitHub already.</li>
<li>
<strong>Inaccurate Code:</strong> Looks right, compiles... until it doesn’t. 🤷‍♀️</li>
<li>
<strong>Terrible at Non-Code Stuff:</strong> If you ask Copilot about philosophy or pop stars, prepare to get answers from another galaxy.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Search Responses:</strong> If your org allows, Copilot sometimes Googles and pastes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s about as reliable as Rachel Berry mid-song, checking her phone for lyrics - confident, but don’t trust it for your solo! 🎤</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🕹️ If You Code It, You Own It!
</h2>

<p>Heard “you break it, you bought it”? Copilot’s version: “you code it, you’re on the hook.” No late-night support call will blame the AI. The only fee you’ll pay is in lost sleep and an overage of Slack messages.</p>

<p>If you sneak in a “five-minute fix” without tests, it <em>will</em> bite back - and guess whose name is at the top of <code>git blame</code>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🙏 Don’t be that person whose only excuse is, “Copilot said it was fine!” That’s not the new “it was like that when I got here” - don’t let it start.</p>
</blockquote>




<h2>
  
  
  👀 Now What? AI Out Loud
</h2>

<p>Wondering what all this RAI talk means for you in the real world? Here’s the deal: any time AI helps out - own it, label it, and make sure everyone else can see it too. Transparency is the new black.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  For Generated Reports &amp; Docs
</h3>

<p>If Copilot whipped up your report (and it’s not code), just tack on a quick footer. Seriously - a copy, a paste, and you’re done. Want to automate it? Set up a user instruction and let Copilot add the credit line for you:<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>---

Generated with the help of GitHub Copilot, as directed by [YOUR NAME]
</code></pre>

</div>



<blockquote>
<p>🕰️ If you want a timestamp, copy it in yourself. Trusting Copilot with dates is like asking your dog to set your alarm - cute, but you’re gonna be late.</p>
</blockquote>




<h3>
  
  
  🏷️ For Commits
</h3>

<h4>
  
  
  Step One: Embrace Conventional Commits
</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>🪦 Confession: I used to be the world’s <strong>worst committer</strong>! think “welp, THAT didn’t work” as a real commit message. And yes, it happened more than once...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, I went on a mission to find a clear, repeatable way to flag my AI-assisted commits. The answer? <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits</a> (plus a linter for good measure). </p>

<p>Never seen one? Here’s what it looks like:<br />
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>feat(api): [JIRA-123] Add api for xyz

[optional bulleted list of changes]

[footers - where the magic happens]
</code></pre>

</div>



<blockquote>
<p>🦄 <strong>Bonus:</strong> You get automated changelogs for just a <em>little</em> extra setup! Honestly, that’s what finally convinced me to use them every single time - no turning back.</p>

<p>🪧 There are plenty of tools out there to help, too! Everything from classic git templates to handy CLI fill-in-the-blanks.</p>
</blockquote>




<h4>
  
  
  Step Two: My DIY Commit Disclosure Guide
</h4>

<p>Since there's no true standard for this (at least, not yet), I want to share my (no-royalties-required) system for full commit-styled AI disclosure. </p>

<p>In every single commit, I add 2 separate footers: one stating exactly how Copilot was involved (cause it <em>always</em> does something) and one is my "signature" that I reviewed, tested, and approved the implementation. </p>

<p>If Copilot played multiple roles? Keep it simple - go with the footer that best matches the most AI hands-on contribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If Copilot only wrote the commit message:<br />
</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  Commit-generated-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;
</code></pre>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>
<p>If I paired with Copilot (clear prompt and step-by-step direction):<br />
</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;
</code></pre>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>
<p>If Copilot wrote most of the code (here, go implement this story):<br />
</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  Generated-by: GitHub Copilot &lt;copilot@github.com&gt;
</code></pre>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>
<p>Always:<br />
</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  Signed-off-by: Ashley Childress &lt;1234-no-reply@github.com&gt;
</code></pre>




<blockquote>
<p>(or your name - unless you really want to blame me 😆)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So at 3am, when Future You (or some poor teammate) <code>git blame</code>s a file, you’ll know who did what. There's really no official standard yet, so go wild - or just slap a robot emoji 🤖 in there and call it done. <strong>Just make it clear and take credit (or blame).</strong></p>




<h2>
  
  
  🚫 Top 3 “Copilot, Stay in Your Lane!” Moments
</h2>

<p>When I was little, my Granny would always say, “Sometimes, you’ve just got to wear your big girl panties.” Translation: there are times when you have to face the music and just deal with what’s in front of you - no shortcuts. If you let Copilot trash production... well, those are the only pants you’re getting.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Copilot is a tool, not a magician.</strong> It’s been <em>confidently wrong</em> enough times to make me seriously question reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Me: “Where’s that logic <em>actually</em> coded?" <br />
Copilot: *conjuring code like a magician’s neverending handkerchief*<br />
Me: “You’ve got to be kidding me...”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>You’re the adult in the room.</strong> You have to know not just what Copilot <em>can</em> do, but also what it <em>can't</em> (or <em>shouldn't</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't be afraid to bench Copilot.</strong> Real debugging is sometimes just you, four friends, and a bunch of “what if...” ideas. AI’s not built for that kind of chaos. 🫠</p></li>
</ol>




<h2>
  
  
  🥊 Avoid Git Blame Drama
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Start with a plan</strong> - don’t just wing it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Try prompting Copilot with TDD</strong>, but know its tests can be as shallow as a kiddie pool if you don't provide the right context and criteria.</li>
<li>
<strong>Never accept code you don’t understand</strong> - have Copilot ELI5 every step until you do.</li>
<li>
<strong>When it matters, write your own tests (or code)</strong>. Copilot sometimes invents magical shortcuts - don’t follow the Keebler Elves into the tree!</li>
<li>
<strong>Disclose everything!</strong> Tag Copilot’s work in your commit messages, READMEs, or reports. Future You will thank you.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  💬 Your turn!
</h2>

<p>Have a Copilot win, a fail, or an epic facepalm moment? Drop it in the comments - bonus points for memes, hot takes, or your best "AI tried, I survived" story. Let’s make RAI actually fun (or at least not completely boring)! ✨</p>

  🛡️ AI Helped, I’m Still to Blame
</h2>

<p>This post was brewed by me - with a shot of ChatGPT, a splash of sarcasm, and zero disclaimers skipped. If you catch bias or a goof, call it out. AI isn’t perfect (neither am I).</p></article>
