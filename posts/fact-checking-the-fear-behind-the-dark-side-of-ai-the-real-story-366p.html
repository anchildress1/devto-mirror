&lt;p&gt;This post is a direct response to four nearly identical articles by &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/abhi_jith_f00c2ff58ac2a7e&#34;&gt;@abhi_jith_f00c2ff58ac2a7e&lt;/a&gt;, all titled “The Dark Side of AI: How ChatGPT Can Lead to Psychosis and Mental Health Concerns,” published today (July 20, 2025):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/abhi_jith_f00c2ff58ac2a7e/latest-the-dark-side-of-ai-how-chatgpt-can-lead-to-psychosis-and-mental-health-concerns-3if8&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/abhi_jith_f00c2ff58ac2a7e/intro-dark-the-dark-side-of-ai-how-chatgpt-can-lead-to-psychosis-and-mental-health-concerns-57g1&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/abhi_jith_f00c2ff58ac2a7e/intro-the-dark-side-of-ai-how-chatgpt-can-lead-to-psychosis-and-mental-health-concerns-437b&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/abhi_jith_f00c2ff58ac2a7e/intro-to-the-dark-side-of-ai-how-chatgpt-can-lead-to-psychosis-and-mental-health-concerns-1dd3&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve reported these posts, though I’m not exactly expecting much discourse against an account ending in “f00c2ff58ac2a7e.” That’s why I’m sharing my response here as a standalone post, in addition to my comments. What follows is nearly identical to my replies to those posts - plus a quick summary of the original articles (so you don’t need to click and give them extra views; trust me, you’re not missing anything) - along with my own perspective, so you know just how strongly I feel about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to copy, share, and amplify. Let’s work together to push back against this kind of fear-mongering and make it clear to every person - young or old: &lt;strong&gt;mental health struggles are never your fault.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#first-a-psa-for-anyone-who-needs-it&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First, a PSA for anyone who needs it:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis &lt;strong&gt;in the U.S., you can call &lt;a href=&#34;https://988lifeline.org/&#34;&gt;988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; anytime, day or night, for free support. 988 is for any topic, offers support in English and Spanish (interpreters for other languages), and lets you talk, text, chat online, or use VP. There’s even a dedicated &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nami.org/support-education/nami-helpline/teen-young-adult-helpline/&#34;&gt;Teen &amp;amp; Young Adult Helpline (#TalktoUs)&lt;/a&gt; with peer support - again, all free and confidential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re outside the U.S., &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.helpguide.org/find-help&#34;&gt;HelpGuide.org&lt;/a&gt; lists helplines for several other countries&lt;/strong&gt;, including the UK, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines, Ireland, Australia, Canada, and India. It’s not global (yet), but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; to recognize warning signs for early mental health crisis intervention and know how to support someone who might be experiencing first-episode psychosis (often seen in teens and young adults prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia). Hallucinations and delusions are well-known symptoms, but early signs &lt;strong&gt;can also look like depression&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s no cure, but schizophrenia and related disorders are very treatable - and treatment today usually means medication and counseling, not hospitals or “scary” interventions. Some helpful resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443&#34;&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia/&#34;&gt;NAMI: About Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#now-to-the-posts&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now, to the posts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central claim of these posts is that the rapid adoption and widespread, frequent use of AI - particularly chatbots like ChatGPT - is responsible for what the author describes as a rise in mental health disorders among teens and young adults. While the term “psychosis” is used (rather than “schizophrenia”), the narrative strongly implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship that simply isn’t supported by research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author includes an anecdote about a young person who used ChatGPT as a sort of “friend,” supposedly leading them to blur the lines between technology and reality.&lt;/p&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#my-biggest-problem-with-this&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Biggest Problem with This
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation is so important - but let’s clear something up: blaming AI (or any single thing) for youth mental health or psychosis isn’t just misleading; it’s flat-out &lt;em&gt;unhelpful&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we take the story at face value (there’s no supporting evidence or sources provided, so that’s a &lt;em&gt;big if&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;it is absolutely NOT their fault!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere &lt;em&gt;suggestion&lt;/em&gt; that a serious, life-altering condition like psychosis could be caused by something a person - young or old - did or didn’t do is not just &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unhelpful&lt;/em&gt;, it’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking is exactly why so many people are hesitant to seek help: they feel like it’s something they “brought on themselves” or could have prevented. The truth is, it’s not anyone’s fault - least of all your own.&lt;/p&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#the-truth-about-psychosis&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Truth about Psychosis
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders typically first appear in teens and young adults, but that’s not because of the latest tech trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/&#34;&gt;NAMI&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“50% of all lifetime mental illness begins by age 14, and 75% by age 24.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been true long before anyone worried about AI, TikTok, or even Pac-Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;teams&lt;/em&gt; of experts actively researching what causes psychosis - technology is just one small piece of a much larger puzzle that includes genetics, environment, stress, trauma, and yes, sometimes technology use (in many forms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2817594&#34;&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found only a &lt;strong&gt;modest link&lt;/strong&gt; between higher computer use in mid-teen years and later psychotic experiences, and even that was mostly explained by other risk factors (mental health and social challenges were present &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the high computer use). No clear “cause and effect,” just a reminder that life is complicated and brains even more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a serious medical topic. Blaming TV, games, the internet, or AI for psychosis is the same tired playbook people have used for decades, and it only makes it harder for people to ask for help. Mental illness is never as simple as a single cause, and fear-mongering or finger-pointing helps no one.&lt;/p&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#why-this-is-important-to-me&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why This Is Important to Me
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#those-closest-to-me&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Those Closest to Me
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with someone in my household who had an untreated mental health condition. It wasn’t schizophrenia, but it deeply shaped my world from my earliest memories. It wasn’t “good” or “bad” - it was simply normal for me. Years later, after I was grown, they finally received help. I wish I could say it was a storybook turnaround. There were good stretches, and some not-so-good ones. Did all those years without support play a role in how things are now? I can’t say for sure - but I know it didn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#my-own-journey&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Own Journey
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with a serious mental health condition in my early twenties (and I’m always willing to talk about it privately if anyone needs support - just reach out). Honestly, I felt “different” long before I ever got the diagnosis. I couldn’t quite name it, and for a long time I just assumed I was “off” in some way. Admitting there might be a problem took a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time; actually seeking help took &lt;em&gt;even longer&lt;/em&gt; and was often inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until college, when I signed up for free counseling sessions (for reasons I can’t even remember - probably thanks to a sibling who worked in the office), that things started to shift. My counselor, Maggie, was the definition of approachable and probably saved my life more than once. One of the first things she did was encourage more frequent sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick PSA:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding the right counselor or therapist can be pure luck - or it can take a lot of searching. If you tried once and it didn’t click, don’t give up. Your “Maggie” is out there, but you’ll never meet them if you don’t keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck with counseling for a long time (in addition to other treatment). Life eventually took us in different directions, and it hasn’t always been as easy since, but I learned how to show up for myself and talk about it. Some days I’m better at it than others, but overall, I’m a happy, healthy adult - and, most importantly, I finally &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#ripple-effects&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ripple Effects
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of respect for my family’s privacy, I won’t go deep here. But as an adult, I’ve seen firsthand how mental health issues can affect not just individuals, but entire families - even those who don’t live under the same roof. The big lesson: it’s not just okay to talk about mental health and seek help - &lt;strong&gt;it’s essential&lt;/strong&gt;. The person in my life who struggled is doing much better now, thanks to a treatment plan that worked for them and continued care.&lt;/p&gt;


&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#be-part-of-the-solution-to-mental-health&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be Part of the Solution to Mental Health
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health struggles - crisis or not - are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; caused by one thing, and they’re never solved by one thing. It takes understanding, openness, and the willingness to address tough topics. Spreading rumors or horror stories like “ChatGPT made her crazy!” only hurts people who are already suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please, be part of the solution. Share. Talk. Show up. Somebody needs it more than you know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on compassion, understanding, and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; support for those struggling - not easy answers or scapegoats. 💛&lt;/p&gt;
