<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ This guide assumes you have access to a paid version of GitHub Copilot. If you're using the free model, remember they may charge <strong>extra premium usage</strong> on top of what is stated here. (Yes, it’s annoying. No, we can’t change it. Yet.)</p>

<p>Ever faced a production incident and thought, “If only I could clone myself and brute-force this root cause?”</p>

<p>Good news: you can’t clone yourself, but you can borrow Copilot’s AI brain (and, with a little strategy, solve issues faster—without nuking your premium usage).</p>

<p>Let’s break down a real, developer-friendly workflow for using Copilot to track down, debug, and document production bugs—without the drama, confusion, or unplanned premium burns.</p>

  🧰 Where to Start (Before Copilot Even Knows There’s a Fire)
</h2>

<p>Resist the urge to throw the entire prod environment at Copilot. Better input = better, cheaper results.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Check your basics:</strong> What errors do you see? When did it start? What systems or tables are involved?</li>
<li>
<strong>Scan logs for obvious fails:</strong> Don’t dump everything—look for timestamps, error keywords, stack traces, or anything weird.

<ul>
<li>You'll also want to exclude those annoying <code>/health</code> and <code>/metrics</code> logs, unless they're explicitly related to the issue.</li>
</ul>


</li>

<li>

<strong>Peek at relevant tables/data:</strong> Query only what you need—skip the full DB export if a few rows tell the story.</li>

<li>

<strong>Export just the relevant stuff:</strong> Save logs/output as <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code> for easy copy-paste.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Limit your window:</strong> 3–4 minutes before to 1–2 minutes after the incident is usually plenty.</li>
<li>
<strong>Target your data:</strong> Pull only the section you think matters.</li>
</ul>


</li>

<li>

<strong>Minimize noise, maximize signal:</strong> Copilot can handle both 10 lines and 10,000 - but you'll always get better results with less (<del>and you'll limit premium usage by eliminating those pesky multi-turn conversations</del> <strong>UPDATE</strong> After I originally posted this, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcaQVnznugA&amp;t=4672s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code livestream</a> confirmed they do not charge extra premium requests for multi-turns in agent mode).</li>

</ul>

  <strong>TL;DR;</strong> Start small - if Copilot needs more, scale up.

<p>I use VS Code Insiders because the Copilot feature set there is the best by a mile.<br>
But hey, if IntelliJ, Eclipse, DataGrip, or even GitHub.com is your jam? You do you. Copilot works everywhere you need it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🪄 ProTip:<br>
If your incident spans multiple apps or repos, use VS Code or GitHub.com—they let you bring in context from multiple places into your Copilot chat.</p>

  🤖 Prompt Copilot: The Fun Part
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>🪄 ProTip:<br>
The trick to getting the right results is to <strong>pick the right model</strong> for the job and <strong>provide explicit context</strong> in every prompt with the use of <code>#selection</code> and <code>#file</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve prepped your evidence. Now let Copilot cook.</p>

<p>Open a new chat in Copilot, or a new workspace for a tidy “incident folder.”</p>

<p>Paste in your logs or data and open them in your editor for extra context magic.</p>

<p>If there's a specific one or two repos you need to reference, add them to the workspace, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Danger: The use of <code>#codebase</code> in this context is not going to do you any favors. If you absolutely must use it, then make up for the extra input by making a super-specific prompt. </p>

  ✨ ProTips for Getting the Best Results
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tell Copilot when it’s right!</strong> When Copilot nails it, just say: "YES, this is exactly the root cause." or if you find it yourself: "THIS is the real problem."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? Keep going... the end is the best part!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat your prompt with <strong>different context</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Switch the model</strong> if answers are vague or off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit your input</strong> if answers are too broad or generalized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterate:</strong> Each prompt should get a bit more specific or focused.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t depend on long chat memory!</strong> They will roll over eventually.</p></li>
<li><p>🌀 Stuck? Save the chat (it’s in your history), <strong>/clear</strong>, and try a new approach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Walk it off:</strong> Sometimes the best debugging happens outside the IDE.</p></li>
</ul>

  </a>
  🔄 Rinse, Repeat, and Trust the Process
</h2>

<p><strong>Stick with it:</strong></p>

<p>Keep iterating, keep switching models, keep changing your angle—until you can say, “YES—here’s the problem!”</p>

<p>Could take 20 minutes… or a couple of hours. Don’t let it eat your whole day (or your Copilot pool).</p>

  📄 The <strong>Really</strong> Fun Part = Make Your Report (aka Let Copilot Flex for You!)
</h2>

<p>Remember all those “YES” and “THIS is the real problem” confirmations?</p>

<p>Now, Agent Mode is really worth the premium because you can save a ton of time and have Copilot summarize the entire session in style.</p>

<p>Prompt it with something like:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight markdown"><code>Using everything confirmed as correct above, generate a concise incident report following #mcpOrFetchTool [BPM template or example link here]. Include all supporting queries and relevant logs. <span class="gs">**DO NOT GUESS**</span> - insert a TBD placeholder instead. Append a footer to the end of the document stating "This content was generated by GitHub Copilot as directed by FirstName LastName on June 25, 2025". Output results directly in #confluenceTool using appropriate confluence-specific styling.

<p>Note the similarities in all of these = <strong>specific</strong> with only relevant <strong>context</strong></p>

<p>Every file in the examples below is already filtered to only <strong>relevant</strong> data (check the first step). You won't get the same results if you use these with a full dump.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>A prod incident related to #selection [logFileSnippet] occurred at exactly 3:32 AM EDT. The affected data makes me think it could be related to #selection [dataDumpErrorRow]. Analyze the codebase starting with #selection [API endpoint] and summarize if that is possible in 1-2 sentences? Briefly explain your reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>I found this log: <code>small log excerpt</code><br>
The stack trace indicates it was thrown from #selection. What are the top 3-4 things that could have caused this in 100 words or less?</p></li>
<li><p>Help me identify any patterns that could explain timeouts based on #file:logOrTableDataFile.csv. If consistent patterns are identified, then scan the logic starting #selection [BL input] and assess the top 3 likely causes. Output a results table with the method name, rating from 1-5 indicating likelihood of cause, and a suggested improvement for the related code.</p></li>
<li><p>An uncaught exception ultimately caught #selection [specific catch block] occurred at exactly 8:02 PM shortly after the batch is initially triggered with a load of X. Use #logFile.txt and identify 3–4 possible causes with a short explanation for each. List them in order starting with the most likely root cause.</p></li>
<li><p>Map info from #logFile.txt to #smallDbDump.csv to output a likely sequence of events. Include a brief explanation and 1–2 ways to mitigate this error in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>#goodRunLog.txt is the expected output for this app, but today we saw #unexplainedMess.txt instead. Did anything change in #favoriteTool [pull_request_diff, list_commits, get_tag, etc] that would explain the sudden change? Output a bulleted list in order of most recent change.</p></li>
<li><p>This screenshot [just paste it] shows a spike in latency at 2:52 PM. Is there anything in #correspondingLogs.txt that would explain this? List all possible offenders ranked in order of most frequent occurrence.</p></li>
<li><p>All queries used by this app are in #queryFolder. List the top 3 problematic queries along with suggested improvements in order, starting with the most impactful. Explain your reasoning for each in less than 20 words.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Detailed summary of what was observed in the data</code> #daoOrSchema.sql Help me identify the root cause. Let’s start with a query of table_a that records all failures of Y. Use the FK to match it to records in table_b and group them in 15-minute intervals by error code to identify spikes. Include total count and average frequency in the result. Output a SQL query that can be executed in MySQL.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>when things start to get really extreme:</strong> /clear #fullLog.txt, #nonsenseDbDump.csv, #selection [API base] #codeFileNobodyWillClaim.java <code>the only explanation I could think of that really doesn't make any sense</code><br>
Look for patterns, recurring errors, smelly code, and anything else that could possibly explain Z. Give me 4 ideas I can use as a starting point for more debugging and tell me 2 things that it couldn't possibly be.</p></li>

<p>Everything I share here is my own perspective—created with the help of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and their friends), but always with a human in the loop. I do my best to catch accidental bias and fact-check, but if you ever spot something odd, let me know! AI isn’t perfect, and neither am I.</p>

<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong> AI helped, but you can blame me for the <strong>chaos</strong>! 🫠</p>
