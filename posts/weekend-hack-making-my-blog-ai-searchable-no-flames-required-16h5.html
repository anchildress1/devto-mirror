<p>First of all—thank you. 🙏</p>

<p>For real. This community has been nothing but encouraging, and it was a huge surprise to end up in the <strong>top seven</strong> last week. I didn’t expect it, but it’s appreciated more than you know. 🫶</p>

<h2>

  </a>
  TL;DR
</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a quick and efficient way to increase traffic to your DevTo blog posts (or anywhere else with a little tweaking)? Try my <a href="https://github.com/anchildress1/devto-mirror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-minute DevTo crawly mirror</a>. Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Clone the repo</strong>. Enter your DevTO username as an env variable in the repo. Delete the existing <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scheduled GHA Workflow</strong> off-peak or manually trigger.</li>
<li>
<strong>Static HTML</strong> hosted via GitHub Pages</li>
<li><strong>Canonical back to Dev</strong></li>
</ol>

  <a href="#starting-with-nothing">

  Starting With Nothing 🔦
</h2>

<p>So, this entire thing started with a conversation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 About what? I honestly can’t remember now—Copilot, debugging, something in that ballpark. Doesn’t matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But somehow—like so many of my rabbit holes—it mutated and morphed until I wasn't exactly at the same place I had started. I really can't explain the series of events that happened after that. I blame it on <em>curiosity</em> more than anything, but I did the one thing I swore I'd never do: I asked ChatGPT to do a quick search—pull one of my posts.</p>

<p>And... <strong>nothing</strong>. Like the post didn’t exist. 🕳️</p>

<p>Okay. 😅 Fine. Let’s take a step back. Next, I went straight to Google and typed the same thing. Results were <em>better</em>—sure. Scroll, scroll, scroll... and <strong>there</strong> it was. My post. Not at the top, but alive. Win. 😏</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 <strong>Real talk</strong>: Do I care about being #1? No, not in the slightest. Honestly, I love my invisibility bubble—keeps things peaceful in my corner of the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here’s the thing: invisibility and AI don’t mix. Because when I need an answer, I don’t open a browser anymore. I yell at my phone: “Hey Google!” Or I pop into ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>

<p>If my posts don’t show up there, they might as well not even exist. 🫤</p>


<hr>

<h2>
  <a href="#d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu">
  </a>
  Déjà Vu 🔮
</h2>

<p>So I’m now blessed with the knowledge that my posts are basically hiding out in the Room of Requirement—you know it’s there, but only if the stars align. And <strong>that</strong> makes it hard to share the advice I keep repeating everywhere else that will listen:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Yes, you can use it for debugging.”</li>
<li>“Of course it can generate the tests.”</li>
<li>“Docs? Oh my god, PLEASE let it write the docs.”</li>
</ul>

<p>By the time I’ve said it for the fifth time, it feels like I’m stuck in reruns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 Honestly, some days I feel like I need a theme song: “Previously, on AI Adventures with Ashley...” 🎵🎶</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. <em>Sometimes</em>, I let AI run wild (it's more fun that way!). My Coding Agent kills it with documentation. I even built a chat mode that plays architect—reverse engineers a repo and spits out mermaid diagrams like it’s dealing cards in Vegas. That one runs in GitHub Actions, then opens a PR, and I'll merge once everything checks out.</p>

<p>But the everyday stuff? It’s not dramatic. It’s small instructions, nudges, prompts. Rinse, repeat, <em>coffee</em>, repeat again. ☕️ It's slow, incremental improvements to be just a little better than yesterday. 🤏</p>

<p>And what drives me absolutely up the wall? The extremes. Either “AI will replace every dev tomorrow” or “AI is useless, don’t bother.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 <strong>Honestly</strong>, it’s like sitting court-side at Quidditch—the little guy zips across the field so fast you think you’ve finally caught up, but nope. He’s already off to something else... and it’s almost always completely wrong, too. 😅</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  <a href="#writing-it-down">
  </a>
  Writing It Down 📕
</h2>

<p>So my solution: write it down. That’s what most of these blog posts are. Whatever comes up that week—whether it’s me digging, someone else asking, or just another repeated question—if I haven’t covered it already, give me a week. I'll get there.</p>

<p>The beauty of this system? Instead of explaining everything for the tenth time, I can just say: “Glad you’re trying this. I think my blog might help—here’s the link. Let me know if you’ve got questions.”</p>

<p>See. Simple, right? 🙂‍↕️ But even <em>that</em> wasn’t enough, because usually by the time I arrived on scene things were in somewhat of a state already. Mostly because what AI <em>was</em> helping with had a knowledge cut-off of January and everything else is wading through Microsoft or GitHub docs looking for any little nibble.</p>

<p>So I set out to find a way to make my DevTo posts truly crawly—<em>without</em>  Dante's DevOps nightmares playing on repeat at the top of every hour. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 Sure, I <em>briefly</em> considered the real solution—custom website, full hosting stack, the whole front-end shebang. But I'm a backend engineer for a reason! My personal site is designed for APIs not MUI. I'd really prefer to keep it that way!</p>
</blockquote>

  <a href="#the-hack-in-action">
  </a>
  The Hack in Action 💻
</h2>

<p>So, I did what any other respectable developer would do with an extra 15 minutes and spark of an idea: I hacked it. What do you get with 3 hours, a solid round of "will OCD win again?" and ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot tag team special? Exactly zero upkeep—mission accomplished. ✅<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre><code>GHA cron → Dev API → static HTML → GitHub Pages → robots.txt
</code></pre>
<div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel">
<div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action">
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>That’s it. No CSS. No fancy layout. Just static content, scheduled on a daily push. Best of all? ChatGPT could <em>finally</em> find my posts. Gemini too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>🦄 <strong>True story</strong>: I spent longer arguing with Leonardo to make a banner image than I did setting up the whole mirror.</p>

  Add A Little Sparkle ✨
</h2>

<p>I'm in no way an expert when it comes to SEO or even scraping in general. I did happen across this tidbit in the 15 minutes of research I did on the subject. I'm still testing this to see what the impact looks like, but seems promising. 😇</p>

<p>In your DevTo settings, you have the option to use the current rich-text markdown editor we all know and love <em>or</em>, you can switch to the legacy version. It's kind of an all or nothing deal, as far as I can tell. So you either have it <em>everywhere</em> or <em>nowhere</em>. But, it does give you access to the yaml front-matter for your posts and the ability to define your own brief description instead of relying on the first ~160 words you post. </p>

<p>It seems like an awfully lot of work though, and I've kinda gotten used to the new markdown buttons (that I never use). So my solution? Let's just hit buttons until I find one that works. 🤓</p>
