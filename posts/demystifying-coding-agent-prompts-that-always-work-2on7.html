<p>🦄 If you’re still hanging out with me—thank you. First time here? Don't worry—everything’s linked from the beginning. We’ve already talked through the magical, autonomous bits and started pulling out repeatable patterns. Now it's time to get real about prompts: what Coding Agent can reliably handle for you in <em>almost</em> every scenario.  </p>

<p>If you have a personal project, simple utility, or other non-critical non-production system? Feel free to experiment and push it further. No reason you can't find out what it can really do under pressure. However, if you prefer to stay in the safe lane a little longer or if your repo is system-critical? All the prompts listed here are 100% safe to hand over without fear of random glitter surprises (not often, anyway!).</p>

  </a>
  It Works, But Now What? 🤔
</h2>

<p>In previous posts, we covered exactly how GitHub Coding Agent works—the safety, review, approve, merge—so what can you actually do with it? Hopefully you’ve taken it for a spin already. If you’re still unsure where to start, here’s what consistently works for me. Just for fun, I've mixed in some of the various ways you can access Coding Agent currently. </p>

<p>Whether you prompt from VS Code, GitHub.com, or the GitHub mobile app, it always does the same thing: cost is one premium request plus GitHub Actions (GHA) minutes, it starts a new <code>copilot</code> branch, executes the <code>.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml</code> workflow (if one exists), and opens a new PR for the prompter (and CODEOWNERS) to review and merge.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> Every example here uses existing <code>copilot-instructions</code>—except the ones where I used a chat mode with a very clear role and explicit boundaries. If your results don’t look similar to these, start troubleshooting there.</p>

  Feature Documentation 📚
</h2>

<p>Stereotype or not, us devs are terrible documenters. It's not even that we <em>can't</em> write good documentation, it's just that on the list of all the random things to do for a new feature—docs usually fall right at the bottom. </p>

<p>Coding Agent is on standby just as soon as I'm code-complete and pushed to GitHub, I hand it all off as a separate task in VS Code: update the README, pull the Jira story, do a gap scan, call out missed scenarios and edge cases, and sanity-check whether tests actually cover the error paths (not just line counts). While it's busy writing the documentation (that I no doubt would have glossed over in under 30 seconds), I'm doing everything else on the tidying-up pre-review prep list.</p>

<p>In this case, the <strong>Delegate to Coding Agent</strong> button in Copilot Chat comes in pretty handy. Results are accessible in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github">GitHub Pull Requests extension</a> if you want to keep your focus in the IDE, too.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> The Pull Requests extension does provide the same functionality as the web UI, but it's really not the most intuitive solution either.

  <a href="#why-not-all-the-documentation">
  </a>
  Why Not All the Documentation? 📚📚
</h2>

<p>There are some cases when the only doc in sight is a lonely README that's been collecting dust by itself in the corner since birth. That's exactly why I wrote the HLBPA (High-Level Big-Picture Architect) chat mode and an XML version designed especially for Coding Agent.</p>

<p>You can copy the raw XML from my <a href="https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/hlbpa.xml">awesome-github-copilot</a> repo. Just paste that directly into Coding Agent from the GitHub UI and click <strong>Convert to file</strong>—no other edits (yet).</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhac0bbzxia7nks259yvb.png%3Fv%3D2025"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhac0bbzxia7nks259yvb.png%3Fv%3D2025" alt="Screenshot GitHub.com prompt Coding Agent with " loading="lazy" width="1052" height="920"></a></p>

<p>Once the chat mode is defined and in context, you can add your own prompt as usual. Here's one that <strong>I wrote explicitly to test the limits of the HLBPA chat mode</strong>. It worked so well that I saved it and reuse it often. It's smart enough to update anything that's already existing, as long as you tell it where to look.<br>
</p>

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
<pre><code>@high_level_architecture.xml this is a complicated app that I need to be brought up to speed on quickly. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive set of docs in the `/docs` folder that covers all major flows in the codebase, broken down into sensible sections per flow. 

First, this app is a part of a distributed infrastructure. Include a high level overview of where this app fits into the systems architecture, but also drill down to the flows from the time the app is first triggered until completion. Generate this information at both a sequence and flow level. 

It's also important to understand the data relationships that are used in this app and how that's different between input from other sources. Use ER diagrams to highlight this app’s primary purpose from a data standpoint in addition to the systems information. 

Next, provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of testing for this app with a focus on any unit or integration tests. Include performance or other specialty tests, if they exist. Identify any areas of concern in the testing setup along with recommendations for improvement, if applicable. 

Fourth, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of this app versus desired best case scenarios. It should highlight both the things this app does well and include gaps in logic or design that may need attention now or could be enhanced later to provide significant benefits in the future. List these in order by impact and timeline of estimated amount of work. For any suggested improvement, include a T-shirt size amount of effort (XS, S, M, L, XLG, etc.). 

Finally the last report is a comprehensive high-level overview of all recent changes, deployments, versions/releases. Use git as needed, but only include items that have already been merged to `main` or commits explicitly included directly or squashed in a release version. Any other branches or dev work should be explicitly ignored. 

If there are any other recommendations for reports that may highlight specific edge cases not covered here then please also include them along with your analysis.

<p>I had a hard time finding a shareable repo that didn't already have documentation until I found a random tab still open with <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry">GitHub's new MCP Registry</a>—<em>perfect!</em> So this screenshot is a slimmed down version of the above prompt. Expect to get even more than this if you execute the full thing at once.  </p>

<p>You may want to break it down into smaller pieces though, unless you've got a solid hour to spend reviewing documentation. On the other hand, if you find yourself treading water in the deep end of the "ginormous app pool" and need answers <em>now</em>? Copy and paste after loading the <a href="https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/hlbpa.xml">HLBPA chat mode XML</a> and then go refill your coffee. You're going to need it! ☕️</p>

<p>💡 <strong>ProTip:</strong> You can adapt this prompt for just about anything. Research tasks are a breeze if you're given a Jira story with a small focus. Start up the MCP and tell it exactly what you're wanting and in which format. Coding Agent can handle most everything Mermaid lists in <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html">their documentation</a>, even if you have to tweak it occasionally yourself.</p>

  Time Saver Version ⏱️
</h2>

<p>Having literally every single doc you can think of in a single round is nice if you already have a good idea of what you're getting into. For that mystery app that nobody remembers even sneaking into the party? You might want to be a bit more direct. The same HLBPA chat mode handles this scenario for me, too, just with a much more targeted prompt. Results are mostly the same, only smaller and much easier to manage when time is a huge factor.<br>

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
<pre><code>Your task is to research functionality related to the endpoint accessible at `/controller/endpoint`, including how this may potentially interact with other systems. Identify any potential influencers to SLAs or places in the code that could have a direct impact if modified. Start with a generalized flowchart that explains what the system is doing. Also include a sequence diagram that clearly outlines the flow of data from input to database. Include anything else you determine to be immediately relevant in thoroughly explaining this functionality and use case.

  Behavior-Driven Test Specs 🧪
</h2>

<p>This is a relatively new prompt that I've adapted (and there’s much more planned in my head that comes later). The first part is plenty enough to get you started with a BDD setup, so you're not having to define individual use cases by hand. I borrowed the new GitHub MCP Registry for this test, too.<br>
</p>

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
<pre><code>Perform a thorough search of this codebase acting as SDET tasked with both identifying and documenting a set of feature-driven Gherkin use cases for this repo. Future work will include automating integration tests using these `.feature` documents. These files should exist in a format easily digestible by any testing framework set up by this repo or complementary to if one does not already exist. It should exist in the /docs/feature folder for now. Also, include a summary report that notates any scenarios already covered by unit or integration tests, as well as opportunities for improvement using automated testing.
</code></pre>

&lt;/svg&gt;

    &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20px" height="20px" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="highlight-action crayons-icon highlight-action--fullscreen-off"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Exit fullscreen mode&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



<p>Results were solid—5 pages of <code>.feature</code> files plus a summary of overlaps with existing tests and the biggest opportunities to improve.</p>

<p>🦄 <strong>I should probably start with a disclaimer:</strong> On the scale of "justifiable fun" that makes up the full collection of Ashley-hack-time-projects, UI falls somewhere between "great excuse to play with Leonardo" and "meh—AI can totally handle that without me!" While I am <em>acutely</em> aware of the various failures in this system, I've yet to invent a better one that I can actually live with for more than a few days. 🤷‍♀️🤣</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GitHub bundles the Playwright MCP for you and it's automatically accessible to Coding Agent in your UI repo. If you don't already have Playwright integration tests set up, it will add a config file or two to make that work. From there it can crawl your UI and draft user-facing guides with on-demand screenshots.  </p>

<p>Prompt I used:<br>
</p>

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
<pre><code>Write user documentation for the UI functionality using Playwright to take screenshots as needed. Store everything related to user-specific content in a repo `/docs` directory with appropriate sub-folders and a how-to guide using stubbed data where appropriate.

&lt;/svg&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



<p>It produced twelve pages of user docs with six different screenshots woven in, including one mobile perspective. A massive time-saver over trying to do this manually!</p>

<p>💡<strong>One gotcha:</strong> The diff preview can look broken because <code>main</code> is the baseline and screenshots don’t exist there yet. Open the file view to confirm the links are fine. As long as the images appear on their own and the relative links are accurate, you're probably fine to merge.</p>

  Fix a Small Bug From a Screenshot 🐞
</h2>

<p>You know those bugs that make absolutely zero sense when someone tries to explain it, but then you <em>see it</em> and suddenly the whole situation is crystal clear? Coding Agent can handle every drop of that same energy. Sometimes, it’s just easier to explain with a screenshot and a "fix this" prompt than trying to explain a problem quickly and with any degree of accuracy. Use a GitHub Issue as your prompt, drop in a screenshot showing the exact problem, and assign it to Copilot.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foatpyq90cpl92l67vh2i.png%3Fv%3D2025"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foatpyq90cpl92l67vh2i.png%3Fv%3D2025" alt="Screenshot GitHub.com using Issue with a screenshot as a Coding Agent prompt" loading="lazy" width="800" height="524"></a></p>

<p>Wait for the eyes emoji 👀 to pop up at the bottom—that means Coding Agent picked up the task and started work.  </p>

<p>In this case, I was having trouble getting Copilot to recognize the exact errors I was referring to without a direct copy-paste. This is way easier and zero formatting nightmares.<br>

<p>🦄 Of course I don't have a great example of a UI fix, even though I explicitly remember saving an example <em>somewhere, at some point</em>. But at whatever point I used to have one, it’s since disappeared. So I recreated it with the backend equivalent. 😉</p>

  Still Want More? 🔭
</h2>

<p>In the time since I first started this post and when I hit "Publish", GitHub added two more potential Coding Agent portals to the list. So here are all the places you wouldn't think to access Coding Agent (I haven't tested <em>all</em> of them, but I've given most a spin at least once):</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the <a href="https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#user-content-additional-tools-in-remote-github-mcp-server">GitHub MCP server's</a> <code>#create_pull_request_with_copilot</code> tool
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent">GitHub Pull Requests extension</a> in VS Code defines a <code>#copilotCodingAgent</code> tool
</li>
<li>In the IDE use the <code>Delegate to Coding Agent</code> button directly in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent#_method-2-delegate-from-chat">Copilot Chat interface</a>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.raycast.com/github/github-copilot">GitHub Copilot Raycast extension</a> adds the option to your Mac toolbar
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/github-copilot-series/github-copilot-with-teams">GitHub App for MS Teams</a> can now give you direct access to Coding Agent
</li>
<li>Respond to PRs on the go or assign issues directly with the <a href="https://github.com/mobile">GitHub mobile app</a>
</li>
<li>If you work with anything Azure, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/roadmap/2025/boards/work-item-integration-with-github-coding-agent">Azure Boards</a> are now integrated with Coding Agent
</li>
<li>Test out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/assignees?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-assignees-to-an-issue">GitHub Copilot API</a> to create an issue and assign it to Copilot programmatically
</li>
</ol>

<p>Considering this is Dohmke's last <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe</a> as CEO, I don't expect this cadence to slow any time soon. 🫟</p>

<p>Yes—the running joke about developers and documentation was intentional (and ChatGPT wants you to know that). The real magic is in turning those stereotypes into working, reusable prompts. True automation isn't far away for small limited contexts, either!</p>
