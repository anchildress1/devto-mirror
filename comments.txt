https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/2pafg|Giorgi Kobaidze posts this “All in on AI, but let’s talk about vibe coding” gem — calling out that AI isn’t magic, it’s a “learn the quirks and make it work for you” deal. I jumped in, we traded notes, sarcasm, and a little chaos. We hit it off. Still friends. 🫶
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/2pagb|First week? No coding. Hand them the repo and an AI chat window, then tell them to interrogate it like it owes them money. “Explain this function like I’m five.” “Okay, now like I’m a developer with trust issues.” By Friday, they’ll either be best friends with the bot or planning its mysterious disappearance — but they’ll know the codebase inside out. 👏
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/2phao|I was never sold on vibe coding — my thing was collecting. Models, prompts, plugins... and once you’ve got a serious collection like that, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. 🏎️
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/2pn3p|Agenic agents aren’t some magic “set it and forget it” cure-all — they’re just shinier hammers. Innovation? Sure. Advancement? Absolutely. But you’re still the one swinging it. You’re still the developer. Now you’ve just got a few more tricks in your toolbox. 🧰
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/30028|Yes, Tungsten is fantastic — I’m not giving that up. But Claude’s problem wasn’t losing the money. Claude’s problem was not knowing why not going bankrupt is better than just… not going bankrupt. Humans make that logic leap without thinking. Claude hits the goalpost and calls it a day. Neural networks aren’t human intelligence, and with what we’ve got today, they’re nowhere close. 🪨
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/300n8|In my previous life, I wore the leadership hat. Wore it well. Hated every second. But I learned how to read people, set the bar so high they needed a ladder, and turn “good enough” into “you nailed it.” Now I just aim that energy at code. 🪜
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/306a2|AI is like any shiny new tool — it needs training. And no, “AI wrote it” isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card. If AI wrote it, if you wrote it, if God himself descended with a divine pull request — it’s still your code, your name, your responsibility. Developer rules don’t change. 🪽
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/307pn|AI isn’t sucking the brains out of the population. People can still think — some of them might even be thinking more. It’s a tool. Treat it like one. And treat people like the messy, brilliant humans they are. 🧠
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/309oh|I’m not losing sleep over the “AI is stealing our jobs” rumor. Jobs change — especially in tech. We signed up for this. So why the shock when it actually happens? Am I threatened? Nope. I love having AI in the mix. But it’s not magic, not a wand, not a big red “do everything” button. It’s about squeezing the best output from the best input. Period. 🛠️
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/30bgl|I don’t just edit AI’s output — I steer it, handle edge cases, and fix what context can’t cover, letting AI code while I focus on solving real problems.
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/306a2|I’m the one out front on our team with AI — not just learning it, but actually shaping how we use it. I’m setting the standards, building the principles, and finding new ways to bolt it onto what already works so the whole process runs smoother. Perfect? No. Helpful? Absolutely. So I say: use it, and use it often.
https://dev.to/anchildress1/comment/30d9l|This one cracked me up — I dropped a thorough reply to an open challenge, only for him to quietly update the post after. Not sure if that was a subtle retreat or just bad timing, but either way, a lot of the key context vanished. My takeaway? If you flat-out refuse to learn, you’re gonna get left in the dust. The world’s moving fast — get on board now, or watch the train leave without you. 🚂
