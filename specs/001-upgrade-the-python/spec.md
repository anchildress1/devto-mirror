# Feature Specification: Ensure Individual Verification and Update of All GitHub Actions Workflows for Python 3.11+

**Feature Branch**: `001-upgrade-the-python`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "every individual get her actions work flu needs to be assisted in potentially updated for the new flu, which was obviously left out of the last spec not cool by the way, so I need you to individually make sure each one of the four existing workflows operate as intended and GitHub actions"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Security Workflow Verified (Priority: P1)

A maintainer verifies that the `security-ci.yml` workflow operates as intended after the Python 3.11+ upgrade.

**Why this priority**: Security checks are critical for project integrity and must be individually confirmed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the workflow and confirming all security and lint checks pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the updated workflow, **When** the security and lint jobs run, **Then** all checks complete successfully and report results.
2. **Given** a new dependency is added, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** pip-audit and bandit scan the new code for vulnerabilities.

### User Story 2 - CodeQL Workflow Verified (Priority: P2)

A maintainer verifies that the `codeql.yml` workflow operates as intended after the Python 3.11+ upgrade.

**Why this priority**: Code scanning is essential for security and code quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the workflow and confirming CodeQL analysis completes for Python code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the updated workflow, **When** CodeQL analysis runs, **Then** results are reported for all Python code.

---

### User Story 3 - Publish Workflow Verified (Priority: P3)

A maintainer verifies that the `publish.yaml` workflow operates as intended after the Python 3.11+ upgrade.

**Why this priority**: Publishing is essential for site updates and must be reliable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the workflow and confirming the site is generated and published to `gh-pages`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the updated workflow, **When** the publish job runs, **Then** the site is generated and published without errors.

---

### User Story 4 - Refresh Workflow Verified (Priority: P3)

A maintainer verifies that the `refresh.yaml` workflow operates as intended after the Python 3.11+ upgrade.

**Why this priority**: Refreshing posts/comments is important for data accuracy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the workflow and confirming posts/comments are refreshed and backups are created.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the updated workflow, **When** the refresh job runs, **Then** posts/comments are refreshed and backup branches are created as needed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a workflow fails due to Python version incompatibility?
- How does the system handle missing dependencies in a workflow?
- What if a workflow is triggered on a non-main branch?
- How are errors reported to maintainers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Each workflow MUST be individually verified to operate as intended after the Python 3.11+ upgrade
- **FR-002**: Each workflow MUST be updated to support Python 3.11+ if required
- **FR-003**: Each workflow MUST report errors and results to maintainers
- **FR-004**: Security and code quality checks MUST run and report results for each workflow
- **FR-005**: Publishing and refresh workflows MUST complete their respective jobs without errors
- **FR-006**: All changes MUST be documented in workflow history
- **FR-007**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the process for verifying workflow correctnessâ€”manual review, automated tests, or both?]

### Key Entities

- **Workflow File**: The YAML file defining each GitHub Actions workflow
- **Job Result**: The outcome of each workflow run (success, failure, logs)
- **Maintainer**: The person responsible for verifying and updating workflows

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All four workflows run successfully on Python 3.11+ without errors
- **SC-002**: Security and code quality checks report results for all workflows
- **SC-003**: Publishing and refresh workflows complete and update the site/data as expected
- **SC-004**: Errors and failures are reported to maintainers within 10 minutes of workflow completion
- **SC-005**: Documentation reflects workflow updates and verification steps

## Assumptions

- Python 3.11+ is available in the CI environment
- All dependencies are compatible with Python 3.11+
- Maintainers have access to workflow logs and results
- Standard GitHub Actions reporting is sufficient for error notification
