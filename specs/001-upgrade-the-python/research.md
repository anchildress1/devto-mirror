# Research Findings: Upgrade Python Implementation to Astral uv

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: Upgrade to Astral uv

## Decisions Made

### Dependency Management Migration

**Decision**: Replace requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt with pyproject.toml using Astral uv
**Rationale**:
- Astral uv is a modern, fast Python package manager written in Rust
- pyproject.toml is the current Python standard for project configuration
- Provides better dependency resolution and virtual environment management
- Aligns with modern Python tooling practices

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep requirements.txt with pip: Rejected due to modernization goals
- Use poetry: Rejected as uv provides similar functionality with better performance
- Use conda: Rejected as overkill for this project scope

### Test Framework Selection

**Decision**: Use Python's built-in unittest framework for basic testing
**Rationale**:
- Minimal setup required (no additional dependencies)
- Sufficient for basic assert true test
- Compatible with uv-managed environments
- Standard library, no installation needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- pytest: Rejected for simplicity (adds dependency)
- No testing: Rejected as feature requires test infrastructure

### Virtual Environment Management

**Decision**: Use uv venv for virtual environment creation and management
**Rationale**:
- Integrated with uv package management
- Faster than traditional venv + pip
- Automatic dependency locking
- Modern tooling alignment

**Alternatives Considered**:
- python -m venv + pip: Rejected for modernization
- conda environments: Rejected as overkill

### CI/CD Integration

**Decision**: Update GitHub Actions to use uv commands
**Rationale**:
- Maintains automation with modern tooling
- Faster dependency installation in CI
- Consistent with local development

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep pip in CI: Rejected for consistency
- Manual dependency management: Rejected for reliability

### Documentation Updates

**Decision**: Update README.md to reference uv commands instead of pip
**Rationale**:
- Ensures accurate setup instructions
- Prevents confusion for new contributors
- Minimal changes focused on command updates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep pip references: Rejected as violates requirements
- Extensive documentation rewrite: Rejected for "minimal" scope

## Technical Constraints Identified

- uv must be available on development machines and CI runners
- Python 3.11+ required for full uv compatibility
- Existing scripts must work unchanged in uv-managed environments
- No breaking changes to functionality

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: uv compatibility with existing dependencies (all standard packages)
- **Low Risk**: CI runner support (uv is widely supported)
- **Low Risk**: Test framework compatibility (unittest is standard)
- **Medium Risk**: Developer adoption (may require uv installation)

## Implementation Approach

1. Create pyproject.toml with current dependencies
2. Remove requirements.txt files
3. Create tests/ directory with basic test
4. Update README.md commands
5. Update CI workflows to use uv
6. Test all functionality remains intact
