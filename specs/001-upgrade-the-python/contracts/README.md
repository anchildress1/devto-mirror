# API Contracts: Upgrade Python Implementation to Astral uv

**Date**: October 12, 2025

## Overview

This feature does not introduce any API endpoints or external interfaces. The devto-mirror project is a utility that generates static HTML files and does not expose APIs.

## No Contracts Required

- **Reason**: The project consists of command-line scripts that process data locally
- **User Actions**: All functionality is executed via CLI, not API calls
- **Data Flow**: Files are read from/written to local filesystem
- **External Interfaces**: Only Dev.to public API consumption (no contracts needed)

## Functional Requirements Mapping

- **FR-001 to FR-007**: All requirements are fulfilled through CLI execution and file operations
- **FR-008, FR-009**: Test and documentation changes are local file modifications

## Conclusion

No OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas are required for this feature implementation.
