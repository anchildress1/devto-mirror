# Specification Quality Checklist: Individual Verification and Update of All GitHub Actions Workflows

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- ✓ Specification focuses on WHAT workflows need to achieve (verification, vulnerability elimination) and WHY (security, reliability)
- ✓ No implementation-specific details (tools mentioned are outcomes, not implementation choices)
- ✓ Written for maintainers and stakeholders to understand workflow requirements
- ✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are explicit
- ✓ Each functional requirement is testable (can verify workflow execution, security findings, timing)
- ✓ Success criteria include specific metrics (time limits, percentages, counts)
- ✓ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes like "vulnerabilities identified" not "bandit runs")
- ✓ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- ✓ Edge cases cover failure modes, timing issues, and security scenarios
- ✓ Scope clearly bounded to four specific workflows with defined responsibilities
- ✓ Assumptions document environmental requirements and constraints

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✓ User Story 1 addresses security workflow with vulnerability elimination (highest priority)
- ✓ User Story 2 addresses CodeQL analysis with quality gates (highest priority)
- ✓ User Story 3 addresses publish workflow verification (medium priority)
- ✓ User Story 4 addresses refresh workflow verification (medium priority)
- ✓ Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- ✓ Success criteria map to all functional requirements
- ✓ 10 measurable success criteria cover all aspects of workflow verification and quality

## Notes

All quality checks passed. Specification is complete and ready for the clarification phase (`/speckit.clarify`) or planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of all four workflows
- Strong focus on security and vulnerability elimination per user requirements
- Measurable success criteria with specific time and quality targets
- Clear prioritization with security workflows as P1

**Recommended Next Step:** Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` to address any ambiguities, or directly to `/speckit.plan` if specification is sufficient.
