  <p>Yes, Tungsten is fantastic â€” Iâ€™m not giving that up. But Claudeâ€™s problem wasnâ€™t losing the money. Claudeâ€™s problem was not knowing why not going bankrupt is better than justâ€¦ not going bankrupt. Humans make that logic leap without thinking. Claude hits the goalpost and calls it a day. Neural networks arenâ€™t human intelligence, and with what weâ€™ve got today, theyâ€™re nowhere close. ðŸª¨</p>
