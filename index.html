It was killing me 🤣 I'm going to get Leonardo trained with this character eventually.

But I also promised one more round, and there’s still way too much I haven’t shared. So, here’s — <small>2025-08-06T11:48:00Z</small></li>
  
    <li><a href="posts/guess-what-i-passed-the-pearson-vue-github-copilot-certification-exam.html">Guess what?! I passed the Pearson VUE GitHub Copilot Certification Exam 🏆✨</a> — Okay, technically, I’ve known this was coming for a while, and honestly, I’ve felt ready even longer than that. Yes, I celebrated with a gift Leonardo subscription to myself. (I’ll be way more excited about it once those 429 errors slow down enough for me to actually play with it again.)

To be honest, I really didn't expect my mostly random experiments into GitHub Copilot to be more than a learning experience. Confession When I first decided to start blogging, it was just another random experiment to see what woul — <small>2025-07-30T06:49:35Z</small></li>

That’s just how it goes in my head - always at full throttle, b — <small>2025-07-23T12:15:00Z</small></li>

    <li><a href="posts/is-github-copilot-safe-the-fun-and-hard-truth-about-responsible-ai.html">Is GitHub Copilot Safe? The Fun (and Hard) Truth About Responsible AI 🚦</a> — It hit me the other day - I haven’t been great about adding RAI disclaimers (especially around here). Most of the time I remember, but when I’m deep in the zone - or stuck on that “Copilot, just LISTEN!” rollercoaster - it’s easy to forget. Now that I’ve gone back and added those RAI footers (like I — <small>2025-07-16T12:05:00Z</small></li>
  
    <li><a href="posts/how-i-blog-with-bots-but-you-can-still-blame-me.html">How I Blog with Bots (But You Can Still Blame Me) 😅</a> — The cover image is a result of me getting very impatient with ChatGPT after the third nearly perfect cover of some random stranger that was supposed to be me. So, I'm yelling, "that's definitely not my face!" and ChatGPT insists theres a resemblance (there's not). It didn't take much for me to give  — <small>2025-07-13T16:48:18Z</small></li>

For whatever reason, my usual username wasn’t available when I first made the account, but my OCD-tendencies finally won out! Odds are, I probably made an account years ago and totally forgot.
